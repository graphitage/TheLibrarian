Generalized likelihood ratio test detector
for a modified replacement model target
in a multivariate t-distributed background
James Theiler
Abstract—A closed-form expression is derived for the gen-
eralized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector of a subpixel
target in a multispectral image whose area and brightness
are both unknown. This expression extends a previous result
(which assumed a Gaussian background distribution) to a fatter
tailed elliptically-contoured (EC) multivariate t-distributed back-
ground. Numerical experiments with simulated data indicate that
the EC-based detector outperforms the simpler Gaussian-based
detectors, and that the relative performance of the new detector,
compared to other EC-based detectors depends on the regime of
target strength and background occlusion.

I. INTRODUCTION
TO OBTAIN a signal processing solution to the problemof subpixel target detection in hyperspectral imagery, one
requires a model for the target signature, a model for the
background distribution, and a model for how the target signal
interacts with the background.
Usually the target signature is treated as “known.” Although
this signature can exhibit considerable variability due to both
extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic material factors
[1], the extent of this variability is in most cases assumed to
be known, and is very often treated as a constant.
The background is not “known” in the same a priori sense
that the target is known, but it is modeled by a probability
distribution that can often be estimated directly from the hyper-
spectral imagery in which the target is sought. The Gaussian
is perhaps the most popular choice; it is parameterized by
a mean vector µ and covariance matrix R. The multivariate
t distribution is an attractive choice: like the Gaussian, it
requires a vector-valued mean and a matrix-valued covari-
ance, but it takes one further parameter, the scalar ν, which
characterizes the tail of the distribution. The multivariate t
is an elliptically contoured (EC) distribution, because the
contours of constant probability density are ellipsoids centered
at µ (indeed, the same ellipsoids that characterize contours
of the Gaussian distribution), but it exhibits fatter tails than
a Gaussian. Manolakis et al. [2], [3] have argued that these
fatter-tailed EC distributions are appropriate for modeling
hyperspectral background variability.

Several models have been described that characterize how
the target interacts with the background. For an opaque target
that occupies a full pixel, there is no interaction, and the
detector is straightforward to the point of trivial. Here, we
have a simple hypothesis testing problem:
Ho : x = z (1)
H1 : x = t (2)
where x is the observed spectrum at a pixel, z is the back-
ground at that pixel (i.e., what the spectrum would be if no
target were present), and t is the target spectrum. There are no
nuisance parameters in this model, so the optimal detector is
given by the likelihood ratio D(x) = pt(x)/pz(x), where pz
and pt are the probability density functions associated with the
background and target, respectively. We can interpret pz(x) is
the likelihood of observing x in a background pixel, and pt(x)
as the likelihood of observing x in a target pixel.
For subpixel targets (or for models that incorporate ad-
jacency effects, or include translucency, such as gas-phase
plume targets [4]), there is an interaction of target with
background. The most common models are the additive and
replacement models, though Vincent and Besson [5] have
recently suggested a hybrid “modified replacement” model that
generalizes both of them, though at the cost of introducing a
second parameter:
H1: x = z+ αt Additive model
H1: x = (1− α)z+ αt Replacement model
H1: x = βz+ αt Modified replacement model
The additive model corresponds to a target whose strength
depends on α, where “strength” in this case might correspond
to intrinsic brightness (or reflectance) of the target, depending
on linear factors that might include illumination, temperature
(for infrared imaging), concentration (especially for gas-phase
plumes), etc. The replacement model treats the subpixel target
as opaque, and having an area (relative to the pixel size) of α;
thus its contribution to the observed signal is proportional
to α but the contribution of the background is correspondingly
diminished by a factor of 1 − α. The modified replacement
model is attractive in that it can account both for the dimin-
ishing background contribution (β < 1) due to an opaque
(or partially opaque) target, and for target strength variability
due to more intrinsic brightness effects. Solid materials often
exhibit spectral variability due, for instance, to powder grain
size, and although that variability may be somewhat complex,

it is often seen in practice that the dominant effect is in the
overall magnitude of the reflectance of the material.
Unlike the full-pixel case, the alternative hypotheses (the
H1’s) for these target-background interaction models involve
unknown, or nuisance, parameters: α, or α and β. For this
reason, they are not simple but composite hypothesis testing
problems. There are a number of approaches for dealing
with composite hypothesis testing problems: Bayes factor [6],
penalized likelihood [7], [8], and clairvoyant fusion [9], [10]
among them. The most popular, and usually quite effective
(albeit not always optimal [11]), is the generalized likeli-
hood ratio test (GLRT), which is based on maximizing the
likelihoods used in the likelihood ratio test, or equivalently
on employing maximum likelihood estimates of the nuisance
parameters in the likelihood ratio test.
Using the GLRT, closed-form expressions have been identi-
fied for a variety of target models on a variety of background
distributions.
For an additive target on a Gaussian background, the adap-
tive matched filter (AMF) is the appropriate detector [12],
[13]; indeed, it is provably optimal as the uniformly most
powerful (UMP) detector [6]. For solid subpixel targets, a
replacement model is appropriate. The target signal is pro-
portional to the fraction a of the pixel that the target covers,
but the background is occluded by that same fraction. For
Gaussian background, this leads to the finite target matched
filter (FTMF) [14]. Finally, a generalization of additive and
replacement is given by the modified replacement model: here
both the target and the background scale, and the Gaussian
GLRT is given by Vincent and Bresson [5]. In [5], both one-
step and two-step variants are derived, and the one-step variant
is called SPADE (Sub-Pixel Adaptive DEtection); the interest
in this paper is with the two-step variant, which I will call
2SPADE.
These are two-step detectors; the mean and covariance are
computed from a (large) sample of off-target pixels, and are
treated as exact and fixed for the pixels under test. For global
methods (in which a single mean and covariance is estimated
for the whole image) and even for semi-local methods (in
which the mean is computed locally, but a single global
covariance is estimated), the sample size will be large and
the two-step methods are appropriate. In practice, we may
not know if a set of pixels are truly target-free, and in that
case some level of contamination may occur. As long as the
contaminating targets are rare and/or weak, the effect of this
contamination will usually be small [15].
But for local methods, in which both the mean and co-
variance are recomputed in a (small) moving window, the
one-step methods are potentially better detectors because they
account for the statistical imprecision in the estimates of mean
and covariance. The one-step derivations are more difficult to
derive, but a one-step AMF is given by Kelly [16], and one-
step replacement (ACUTE) by Vincent and Bresson [17], and
one-step modified replacement (SPADE) [5]. In all three of
these cases, as the sample size becomes large, the one-step
detector approaches the two-step detector.
The extension of these two-step detectors to elliptically-
contoured multivariate t-distributed backgrounds has been

ground, here called EC-2SPADE.
Also, beyond Gaussian and multivariate-t are non-
parametric methods, such as NP-AMF [20], which enable far
more flexible modeling of the background.
II. SET UP THE PROBLEM
A. Background model
In the absence of target, the background is assumed to be
distributed as a multivariate t distribution. A background pixel
spectrum is denoted z ∈ Rd where d is the number of spectral
channels in the hyperspectral imagery. Here,
pz(z) = c [(ν − 2) +A(z)]
−(d+ν)/2 (3)
where c is a normalizing constant, ν is a scalar parameter that
characterizes the tail of the distribution, and
A(z) = (z− µ)′R−1(z− µ) (4)
is a squared Mahalanobis distance. Here, µ and R are the
mean and covariance of the background, and the fact that p(z)
depends on z through A(z) ensures that the distribution is
elliptically contoured. Note that in the limit as ν → ∞, the
distribution becomes Gaussian. For ν ≤ 2, the distribution is
so fat-tailed that the second moment does not exist.
B. Target-background interaction model
Under the null hypothesis (which is that the target is not
present in the given pixel), the observed spectrum is the
background. The alternative hypothesis is that the target is
present. The target has a known signature t, but what is
observed is a linear combination of target and background.
Thus:
Ho : x = z (5)
H1 : x = βz+ αt (6)
with constraints 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ α.
III. GLRT SOLUTION
Because this is a two-step solution, we will begin with the
assumption that we have an adequate estimate of µ, R, and ν,
usually obtained from a large number of background pixels.

Under the hypothesis that a target is present, we have x =
βz+ αt, where β and α are unknown. Then
z =

and the probability distribution associated with observation x
is given by

The GLRT detector the is based on the likelihood ratio,
maximized over the nuisance parameters; specifically
D(x) =
maxα,β px(α, β; x)
px(0, 1;x)
=
px(α̂, β̂; x)
pz(x)
(10)
where α̂ and β̂ are the values (they are both functions of x)
that maximize px(α, β; x).
We will begin with maximization over α. This occurs at
α̂ = argmaxα px(α, β; x) (11)
= argmaxα A

Observe that

Thus, if we write

(

then we have

= a+ bβ−1 + cβ−2 = q(β) (18)
where q(β) is a scalar quadratic expression in β−1 with
a = µ′Qµ, (19)
b = −2µ′Qx, (20)
c = x′Qx. (21)
With α = α̂, our expression for likelihood in Eq. (9)
becomes
px(β; x) = px(α̂(β,x), β; x) (22)
= cβ−d [(ν − 2) + q(β)]−(d+ν)/2 (23)
Writing the log likelihood (minus a constant) for hypothesis
H1, we have
L1(β; x) = log px(β; x)− log c (24)
= −d log β −
d+ ν

log [(ν − 2) + q(β)] (25)
To maximize this log likelihood we take the derivative with
respect to β and set the result to zero:

L1(β; x) = −dβ−1 −
d+ ν

∂

q(β)
(ν − 2) + q(β)

Multiplying both sides by (ν − 2) + q(β), we obtain
0 = −dβ−1[(ν − 2) + q(β)]−
d+ ν
2
[−bβ−2 − 2cβ−3]
(27)
Now, multiply both sides by −β3/ν:

(33)
Note that since A > 0 and C < 0, we can be sure that β̂ > 0.
We can further observe that β̂ = 1 whenever −C ≥ (A+B).
Finally, given α̂ from Eq. (14) and β̂ from Eq. (33), the
GLRT target detector for the modified replacement model is
given by Eq. (10).
A. Special case: ν →∞
In the ν →∞ limit, the EC distribution becomes Gaussian.
The expressions for A, B, and C become
A = d (34)
B = −b/2 = µ′Qx (35)
C = −c = −x′Qx (36)
which is consistent with Eq(6) from Ref. [5].
B. Remark on Q
Note that Eq. (16) can equivalently be written
Q = R−1/2
(

R−1/2 (37)
which can be interpreted as a projection operator sandwiched
between two whitening operators. If we consider the matched
filter vector
q = R−1t/
√
t′R−1t (38)
then we have another expression for Q given by
Q = R−1 − qq′ (39)

IV. CLAIRVOYANT DETECTOR
If α and β were known, then the so-called clairvoyant
detector [21] provides optimal detection, but it is an odd
scenario to know the strength of the target without knowing
whether or not the target is present. Still, the clairvoyant
provides a useful upper bound on the performance of a target
detector, and shows the penalty paid by replacing the true
(but unkonwn) α and β with the estimates α̂ and β̂ which
are recomputed for each pixel. The detector is given by any
monotonic transform (h) of the likelihood ratio:
D(α, β,x) = h
(
px(α, β; x)
pz(x)
)
. (40)
If we let
h(w) =

then

−A(x). (43)
V. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATION
Fig. 1 shows ROC curves, illustrating detector performance
for α = 0.2 and a range of values of β. One very general
trend is that detection becomes harder as β gets larger, and
more background signal is mixed in with the target signal.
The performance is computed using simulated data, and
since that simulated data is based on an elliptically-contoured
(EC) multivariate t background, it is not surprising to observe
that the EC-based algorithms (shown with solid lines) gener-
ally outperform their Gaussian counterparts (dashed lines).
We see for small values of β that the 2SPADE and EC-
2SPADE are the best detectors, with EC-2SPADE outperform-
ing 2SPADE by a considerable margin. As β increases toward
1−α, the FTMF and EC-FTMF algorithms begin provide the
best performance, with EC-FTMF outperforming FTMF. This
cross-over in ROC curve performance between 2SPADE and
FTMF was also observed by Vincent and Besson [5]. Finally,
as α→ 1, the EC-AMF exhibits the best performance.
Similar curves are seen in Fig. 2, but here α = 0.6 which
provides more examples with α+ β > 1. For 0.3 ≤ β ≤ 0.5,
we see that EC-FTMF outperforms EC-2SPADE. For β = 0.6,
EC-2SPADE is best, but for β ≥ 0.7, EC-AMF outperforms
EC-2SPADE. On the other hand, in none of the cases here
is EC-2SPADE the worst detector, and it is never as bad as
EC-AMF at small β or EC-FTMF at large β.
Because we are comparing performance to the optimal clair-
voyant detector, we can see that, at their points of optimailtiy,
the EC-FTMF (at β = 1− α = 0.8) and EC-AMF (β = 1.0)
detectors are very nearly optimal in their performance. By con-
trast the EC-2SPADE detector does not seem to approach the
performance of the clairvoyant detector. Fitting two parameters
instead of one seems to incur a performance penalty.
VI. DISCUSSION
Applied to simulated data, tailored to the assumptions of the
new detector, the new detector performs well. Further work
will be needed to examine how well this detector behaves in
the “wild,” with real targets in real imagery.
Introducing, and optimizing over, more parameters does
lead to a more flexible detector, but not necessarily a more
powerful one. We saw that imposing an assumption (e.g., that
β = 1 − α) that reduced the number of free parameters led
to improved detection performance even when the assumption
was only approximately true.

Fig. 1. ROC curves showing detector performance for a range of β values from 0.3 to 1.0. For these simulations, N = 107 matched-pair samples are
generated; for each pair, one is without target (x = z) and one includes target (x = βz + αt). The data are simulated from a multivariate t distribution,
with d = 10 and ν = 10, mean µ = [2, 2, . . . , 2]′, and unit covariance R = I . The target signature is t = µ+ [T, 0, . . . , 0], with T = 15, and the target
strength for all these simulations was α = 0.2. (Very roughly speaking, the target is “three sigmas” away from the background mean.) Note that three curves
are drawn for each case in order to provide a sense of trial-to-trial variability; for the curves here, however, that variability rarely exceeds the linewidth on
the plots.

Fig. 2. ROC curves showing detector performance for a range of β values from 0.3 to 1.0. Same as Fig. 1, but here α = 0.6 (three times larger) and T = 5
(three times weaker), so there is still a roughly three-sigma distance from the target to the mean.

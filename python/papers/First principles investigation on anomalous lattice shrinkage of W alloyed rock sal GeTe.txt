ABSTRACT 
According to Vegard’s law, larger radius atoms substitute for smaller atoms in a 
solid solution would enlarge the lattice parameters. However, by first-principles 
calculations, we have observed unusual lattice shrinkage when W replaces Ge in rock 
salt GeTe. We attribute this anomalous contract to the larger electronegativity 
difference between W and Te than between Ge and Te, which results in shorter W-Te 
bonds and pronounced local distortion around W dopants. The present work would 
provide new insight into the lattice parameter determination and a deeper 
understanding of the structural properties of ternary solid solutions. 
 
1. Introduction 
Intriguing narrow bandgap semiconducting chalcogenide GeTe have gained 
extensive attention as phase-change data storage media [1, 2]. Doping is a powerful 
way to improve its properties [3-5]. Upon doping, the change of lattice spacing will 
affect its elastic constants, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity. Thus, 
determining the valid lattice parameter of doped GeTe is of great importance. 
Vegard’s law [6] has enjoyed long-lasting popularity by providing an estimation that 
the lattice parameters vary linearly with the solute size and concentration at a constant 
temperature when two constituents form a continuous solid solution, in which the 
solute atoms or ions distribute randomly among the solvent matrix. However, we have 
observed an abnormal shrinkage of GeTe when more massive W substitutes smaller 
Ge, which is in contrary to lattice expansion as predicted by Vegard’s law. The origin 
2 
 
of such counterintuitive observation remains ambiguous. 
Several similar cases have been reported previously. For example, smaller Ge 
substitute larger Ni renders lattice dilation [7]. Fe-Ni binary alloy [8] also shows the 
opposite volume change, which could be explained by a numerical model based on 
interatomic spacings. However, this model requires that the interatomic spacings must 
be independent of other atoms in the neighborhood, which could be hardly fulfilled in 
ternary systems like W doped GeTe. In Ag-Au alloys [9], larger Ag substitute smaller 
Au decreases the lattice parameter due to electronic interactions between the outer 
electron shells of Ag and Au. This proposition provides us valuable clues that the 
radius of a solute atom would change by the transfer of electrons between high-energy 
electron shells of the solvent and the solute atoms. 
Vegard’s law could be violated when factors on the electronic level show a more 
significant impact on the lattice parameters. In the present work, we have investigated 
the structure of W alloyed GeTe from the perspective of chemical bonding on the 
electronic scale through first-principles calculations. We attribute the anomalous 
shrinkage to the electronegativity effects between W and Te, which render shorter 
W-Te bonds and denser local structures around W. 
 
2. Computational methods 
The ab initio calculations were performed within the framework of density 
functional theory (DFT) using projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential 
method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [10]. The 
generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and a cutoff of 
300 eV were applied for the structural relaxation and self-consistent calculations [11]. 
Strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-generalized gradient 
approximation (SCAN) has been reported to achieve remarkable accuracy for lattice 
constants [12]. Thus, it was applied to confirm the anomalous volume shrinkage 
obtained by PBE. Gaussian smearing with a smearing width of 0.02 eV was used to 
determine the partial occupancies. The Gamma centered k-mesh was set to 4 × 4 × 4 
for relaxation and ab initio self-consistent calculations. 
3 
 
The initial configuration is a rock salt 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of WmGe32-mTe32 (m = 
0, 1, 2, 3) containing 64 atoms (WGeTe), where W and Ge occupy one sublattice 
while Te ions occupy the other sublattice. WGeTe models with different 
configurations were relaxed using the conjugate-gradient method before performing 
ab initio self-consistent calculations. As full relaxations for WGeTe would induce 
structural collapse [13], we force the models to retain their original rock salt 
symmetry by implementing symmetry preserved relaxations in terms of cell volume 
and ionic positions, respectively. The relaxations were terminated when the energy 
difference between iterations was less than 1.0 × 10-6 eV. According to our 
calculations for WmGe32-mTe32 (m = 2, 3), the configurations that W dopants locate 
near to each other would result in lower total energy than randomly distributed ones. 
Therefore, only energetically favorable configurations are shown in the article. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
As shown in , the lattice parameter of W-GeTe decreases with increasing W 
concentration calculated by both PBE and SCAN. It can be seen that the lattice 
parameter of pristine GeTe calculated by PBE and SCAN is 6.013 Å and 5.936 Å, 
Fig. 1 Calculated lattice parameters of W-GeTe alloys. Results calculated by PBE were shown 
in black squares, and SCAN results were depicted by red circles, while the lines and arrows are 
guides for eyes. Insets are local structures around central Ge or W for Ge32Te32, W1Ge31Te32, 
W2Ge30Te32, W3Ge29Te32 
4 
 
respectively. They are both in good agreement with the experimental data measured at 
773 K (6.024 Å) [14]. The observation that the lattice parameter and cell volume 
decrease with the increasing concentration of larger radius dopants is in direct 
contrary to Vegard’s law. Meanwhile, the average bond length ~ 2.747 Å for W-Te 
bonds is shorter than Ge-Te bonds (~ 2.951 Å) in W1Ge31Te32 , as shown in the inset 
of . Hence, W would not only induce cell volume shrinkage but render compact local 
structures as well. Furthermore, W-Te and W-W bonds distort the rock salt structure 
by introducing non-orthogonal bonds. The local distortion is so severe that the rock 
salt lattice could hardly be preserved when W concentration reaches 9.375 at.% 
(W3Ge29Te32) as shown in the inset of . Therefore, we abandon models with W 
concentration higher than W3Ge29Te32 in our symmetry preserved relaxations. The 
short and distorted W-Te bonds would be the origin of the peculiar volume shrinkage. 
 
As shown in , W is surrounded by blue surfaces, indicating that W loses its outer 
shell electrons (-0.0055 e/bohr3) after bonding with six neighboring Te. On the other 
hand, yellow surfaces (+0.0055 e/bohr3) are observed between W-Te, suggesting that 
several electrons of W transfer to Te, resulting in W-Te bonds. The not fully occupied 
5p orbitals of Te play a key role in accommodating the W outer shell electrons. 
Moreover, the yellow surfaces around W-Te are much larger than Ge-Te, indicating 
Fig. 2 Charge density difference (CDD) around W in W1Ge31Te32. The yellow (blue) surfaces 
indicate 0.0055 e/bohr3 increase (decrease) of charge density after bonds formation 
5 
 
that more electrons are involved in W-Te bonding.This character results in strong 
W-Te interactions and hence short W-Te bonds. Therefore, we propose that W loses its 
outer shell electrons, which are accommodated in Te 5p orbitals when forming strong 
chemical interactions with Te. Consequently, the compact local structure around W 
and the abnormal cell volume shrinkage are observed.

W3Ge29Te32 0.505 0.350 -0.364 
 
Bader charge transfers can estimate electron transfer during bonds formation[15]. 
As shown in Table 1, W and Ge lose their electrons while Te obtains them. It is 
noteworthy that W loses 0.616 e in W1Ge31Te32 when it is coordinated by six Te ions. 
On the other hand, the Bader charge transfer of W decreases when the first 
coordination shell includes another W (0.505 in W2Ge30Te32 and W3Ge29Te32). 
However, W still loses more electrons than Ge, whose Bader charge transfers are 
among 0.350 – 0.425 e. This might be attributed to the lower electron affinity of W 
nucleus to its outer shell electrons, namely the 2 electrons in the 6s orbital and the 4 
electrons in the 5d orbital. Bader charge transfer data have demonstrated the former 
proposition that W loses outer shell electrons and induces short and strong W-Te 
bonds, which shrink the local structure as well as decrease cell volume of WGeTe.

Further analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) unravels the bonding 
properties of WGeTe on the electronic scale. The values of ELF vary from 0 to 1, 
representing different types of chemical bonds with various strengths [16]. Both the 
three-dimensional display and a two-dimensional slice of ELF around W are depicted 
in . The ELF around W is below 0.68, as shown in  (a), which could be reconfirmed 
by the blue area within the contour line indicating ELF < 0.1, as depicted in  (b). 
Low ELF values indicate that the outer shell electrons around W are delocalized. On 
the other hand, the electrons are localized around Ge, forming nearly uniform 
covalent bonds with Te as depicted in  (a, b), which is consistent with the bonding 
environment in pristine GeTe. Besides, as shown in  (c), the highest ELF value 
between W-Te (~ 0.665) lies at 0.846 Å away from Te, which is ~ 1/3 of the W-Te 
bond length (2.747 Å), demonstrating that the electrons forming W-Te bonds are 
localized close to Te. Such observation gives another indication that Te accepts outer 
shell electrons of W, constructing short bonds and resulting in denser structures in 
WGeTe.  
 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, by ab initio calculations, we revealed anomalous volume shrinkage 
and compact local structure when massive W replaces smaller Ge in rock salt GeTe 
alloys. The electron transfer from W to Te results in shorter ionic W-Te bonds and

thus reduced lattice parameters. We demonstrate that electronegativity difference 
between dopant and host atoms is crucial in determining lattice parameters of 
complex alloys.

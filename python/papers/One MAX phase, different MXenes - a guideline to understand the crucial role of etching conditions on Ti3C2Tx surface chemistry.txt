ABSTRACT  
MXenes are a new, and growing, family of 2D materials with very promising properties for a 
wide variety of applications. Obtained from the etching of MAX phases, numerous properties 
can be targeted thanks to the chemical richness of the precursors. Herein, we highlight how 
etching agents govern surface chemistries of Ti3C2Tx, the most widely studied MXene to date. 
By combining characterization tools such as X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron,  Raman and 
electron energy loss spectroscopies, scanning and transmission electron microscopies and a 
surface sensitive electrochemical reaction – the hydrogen evolution reaction, HER – we clearly 
demonstrate that the etching agent (HF, LiF/HCl or FeF3/HCl) strongly modifies the nature of 
surface terminal groups (F, OH and/or O), oxidation sensitivity, delamination ability, nature of 
the inserted species, interstratification, concentration of defects and size of flakes. Beyond 
showing how using these different characterization tools to analyze MXenes, this work 
highlights that the MXene synthesis routes can influence targeted applications. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
MXenes are among the newest and largest family of 2D materials with demonstrated 
applications in diverse fields such as electromagnetic interference shielding [1], transparent 
conductive films [2], wireless communication [3], hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis [4–7], 
3 
 
supercapacitors [8], batteries [8],
 
catalysis [9], photocatalysis [10],
 
hydrogen storage [11], gas 
and biosensors [12,13], electromechanical actuators [14], pH and humidity sensor [15,16], 
nanomedicine [17] or gas and liquid separation and purification[18,19]. The properties and 
potential applications of these materials have been the subject of several recent reviews[20–25].  
This very broad spectrum of applications is mostly due to the high versatility of the MXene 
composition and thus of their related properties. Indeed, these materials are synthesized by 
selectively etching the A element from the Mn+1AXn phases, a family of about 150 different 
members of layered ternary carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides [26], where M is an early 
transition metal, A is an element mostly from columns 13 or 14 of the periodic table (i.e. group 
IIIA or IVA), X is C and/or N and n = 1 to 3, leading to the formation of many different Mn+1Xn 
metal carbides and/or nitrides [27]. To date, more than 30 different MXenes have already been 
synthesized and many others have been theoretically predicted [24],[28]. Beyond the possibility 
to tune the MXene composition and related properties by changing the MAX phase precursor, it 
is well-established that different etching protocols lead to Mn+1XnTx flakes with different T 
terminal groups (F, OH and/or O), that can also strongly modify MXene properties [29–32]. 
Although crucial for many applications, the effects of MXenes functionalization on properties is 
still in its infancy because of the limited number of etching processes and the need to design 
characterization protocols that can accurately quantify the nature of these terminations and relate 
them back to the synthesis methods.  
To date, several etching agents have been studied, the most common of which are HF [33], 
NH4HF2 [34], LiF in HCl or LiCl in HF [8,35]. Moreover, LiF can be replaced by other salts 
such as NaF, KF, CsF [8].  More recently transition metal-fluorides were used, such as FeF3 and 
CoF2 [36,37]. Non-fluorinated agents, such as alkali based compounds have also been used [38–
4 
 
40]. Other methods, including electrochemical etching [40,41] and etching with molten salts 
[42], have also been used. The choice of the etching agent has been shown to have a large impact 
on the surface chemistry, oxidation sensitivity, hydrophilic properties, delamination ability, 
conductivity, nature of inserted cations, size of flakes and degree of defects among other 
properties [36,43]. 
Although several studies compared the effect of different etching agents [36,43], a straight 
and systematic comparison of the Ti3C2Tx surface chemistries obtained using the same initial 
MAX phase powder and combining characterization tools such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy in the same study is currently 
lacking in the literature. Additionally, many studies have focused on the etching of Ti3C2Tx using 
HF but the etching conditions, such as temperature, duration, HF concentration can vary 
considerably from one report to another. This is mainly due to the fact that the structural and 
physicochemical properties of the initial Ti3AlC2 powders (e.g., grain size, crystallinity, purity, 
synthesis protocol) vary, thus rendering a direct comparison between different studies difficult. 
For example, Kong et al.[44] showed that the Ti3AlC2 synthesis method (combustion or 
pressureless synthesis) significantly affects the electrochemical properties of the obtained 
MXenes. Shuck et al. [45] illustrated also the major role of the MAX synthesis method on the 
corresponding MXene properties. The use of the same initial MAX phase is therefore crucial for 
a rational study of the role of the etching agents on MXene properties.  
The purpose of this work is to analyze the influence of different etching agents on the surface 
chemistries of Ti3C2Tx multilayers obtained from the same MAX phase batch. We chose to focus 
on three different etching agents: HF, LiF/HCl and FeF3/HCl as they result in very different 
surface chemistries. Moreover, for each etching agent, two different batches were prepared: for 
5 
 
one batch, the etching conditions are described as soft; for the other the conditions were harsher. 
This work does not aim at precisely studying the effect of each synthesis parameter such as 
temperature or concentration for each etching agent, but it intends to highlight, for a given 
etchant, how the surface chemistries can be impacted by simply adjusting the synthesis 
conditions. Therefore, a complete set of characterizations (XRD, SEM, EDS, XPS, Raman, 
TEM-EELS) was performed to determine structural features of the different Ti3C2Tx multi-
layers. Obtaining significantly different surface states for Ti3C2Tx was also used as a helpful 
database to confirm or rebut assignments of spectroscopic signals (Raman, XPS) proposed in the 
literature. This was also useful to provide a better understanding of differences observed in XRD 
patterns. Lastly, in order to further highlight the crucial role played by the synthesis conditions 
on the surface properties, the hydrogen evolution reaction, HER, was used as a probe reaction as 
it is mainly driven by the surface properties of the material under study.  
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Synthesis of materials 
To produce Ti3C2Tx MXene powders (6 samples), 3 different etching agents were used: 
HF, LiF/HCl and FeF3/HCl with two quite different conditions (labelled as soft and harsh). 
Systematically, 0.5 g of the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase precursor (initial particles sizes < 25 m, see 
ESI part I for MAX synthesis) was used.  
Ti3C2-HF10 and Ti3C2-HF48. The Ti3AlC2 powder was gradually added to 10 mL of 
hydrofluoric acid, HF, under stirring. [Safety Note: hazardous product requiring appropriate 
protocol]):   
- 48 wt.% - Sigma-Aldrich - for Ti3C2-HF48 (harsh conditions) 
6 
 
- 10 wt.% for Ti3C2-HF10 (prepared by dilution of HF-48wt%) (soft conditions)  
The mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 24 h before the centrifugation step.  
Ti3C2-Li-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-72/60. The Ti3AlC2 powder was gradually added to 10 mL of 
0.8 g of LiF ( 99%, Sigma) dissolved in 10 mL of 9 mol L
-1 
HCl (prepared by HCl 37%, Sigma 
Aldrich). Thus, the initial F/Al atomic ratio is of 12. The reaction was running for 24 h at 25 °C 
(Ti3C2-Li-24/25 – soft conditions) or 72 h at 60 °C (Ti3C2-Li-72/60 – harsh conditions) under 
stirring. This synthesis method is partly based on the work of Alhabeb et al. [43]. 
Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 and Ti3C2-Fe-72/60. Ti3AlC2 was gradually added to 10 mL of 1.716 g of 
FeF3,3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 10 mL of 9 mol L
-1 
HCl (prepared by HCl 37%, Sigma 
Aldrich). As in the case of LiF/HCl etching method, the F/Al atomic ratio is of 12. The reaction 
was running for 24 h at 25 °C (Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 – soft conditions) or 72 h at 60 °C (Ti3C2-Fe-
72/60 – harsh conditions) under stirring. This synthesis method is partly based on the work of 
Wang et al. [36].  
Except for Ti3C2-Li-24/25, the suspension obtained after the etching step was centrifuged 4 
times at 6000 rpm for 6 min with ultrapure water (these washing cycles are sufficient to reach a 
supernatant pH value higher than 5) and the supernatant liquid was systematically removed. The 
resulting sediment was then filtered using a vacuum-assisted filtration device (PVDF membrane, 
0.22 m pore size), washed several times with ultrapure water, and dried one night at room 
temperature under air. As already proposed by some of us [36], the powders were finally washed 
in 350 mL of deaerated water during 4 h to remove aluminum impurities following by filtering 
and drying at room temperature under air during one night. The powders are then weighted and 
stored under inert atmosphere. 
7 
 
For Ti3C2-Li-24/25, the suspension obtained after etching, including Ti3C2Tx and non-reacted 
Ti3AlC2, was centrifuged 8 times at 6000 rpm for 6 min and the supernatant liquid was 
systematically removed. The black Ti3C2Tx slurry was then carefully collected and separated 
from the surface of the sediment Ti3C2Tx/Ti3AlC2 with a spatula as proposed by Alhabeb et al. 
[43]. The slurry and the sediment were then filtered separately, washed and dried one night under 
air at room temperature and finally weighted and stored under inert atmosphere.  
2.2  Characterization of materials  
XRD analysis of the MXene powders were carried out with a PANalytical EMPYREAN 
powder diffractometer using CuK radiation source (K1 = 1.5406 Å and K2 = 1.5444 Å). XRD 
patterns were collected between 5 and 70 ° with a 0.07 ° step and 420 s dwell time at each step. 
An ultra-fast X-Ray detector (X’Celerator) was used to collect the signals. The identification of 
Ti3AlC2, TiC, and LiF phases was performed with the HighScorePlus software (PANalytical©) 
and by comparison with the ICDD database reference files. Phase identification of MXene from 
the XRD patterns is based from our previous works [46].  
The XPS analysis were carried out with a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer using a 
monochromatic Al Kα source (1486 eV, 10 mA, 15 kV). When required, a charge neutraliser 
system was operated for the analysis. Instrument base pressure was 9×10
−8
 Pa. High-resolution 
spectra were recorded using an analysis area of 300 μm×700 μm
2
 and a 20 eV pass energy. 
These pass energies correspond to Ag 3d5/2 FWHM of 0.55 eV. Data were acquired with 0.1 eV 
steps. All the binding energies were calibrated with the C1s (C-Ti-Tx) binding energy fixed at 
281.9 eV as an internal reference since this component is present in all MXenes and it is very 
well distinguished from other surface contaminations contributions.  
8 
 
Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 
confocal Raman microscope with a CCD detector. Spectra were acquired at RT using an 
excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm, supplied by an internal He-Ne laser. The power delivered at 
the sample is less than 1 mW. An 1800 grooves.mm
-1
 grating is used resulting a spectral 
resolution of 0.5 cm
-1
. The spectrometer is calibrated by a silicon wafer. 
It is important to note here that all Raman and XPS spectroscopies were performed on fresh 
samples (i.e. less than 24 h after synthesis) except when it is specified (aged samples). 
The Al, Ti, Li and Fe contents of the different Ti3C2Tx were determined by Inductively 
Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a PerkinElmer Optima 
2000DV instrument. The determined contents of each element were normalized to 3 Ti atoms. 
The morphology of the MXene powders was studied using a field emission gun scanning 
electron microscope (FEG-SEM) 7900F from JEOL. This microscope is equipped with an 
Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) from Brücker (with Esprit software) allowing the 
determination of the O, F, Al, Ti, Cl and C contents. The determined contents of each element 
were normalized to 3 Ti atoms. 
Specific surface area measurements were performed using nitrogen adsorption at -196°C 
with a TRISTAR 3000 gas adsorption system. Prior N2 adsorption, the powder samples were 
degassed under secondary vacuum for 12 h at 80 °C. The BET equation was used to calculate the 
specific surface area of the samples (SBET in m
2
 g
-1
).  
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed on the Ti3C2-Li-
72/60 sample. TEM samples were prepared by diluting the powder into water followed by 
ultrasonication for 2 minutes with a power of 150 W to separate the Ti3C2Tx flakes. A drop of the 
colloidal suspension was then deposited on copper grid covered with a lacy carbon film. The 
9 
 
observed areas on the sample were investigated using energy filtered electron diffraction (EFED) 
and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Both short range and long-range order was 
probed in the MXene structure. Experiments were performed in a JEOL 2200 FS TEM, operating 
at 200 kV, and equipped with an in-column omega filter. A 10 eV slit was used to acquire the 
EFED patterns. The energy resolution was about 1.0 eV and the collection angle was about 5 
mrad. EEL spectra in the core losses were recorded. The backgrounds of the core-losses spectra 
were extracted using a power law and the multiple scattering effect was removed using the 
Fourier-ratio method.  
2.3 Electrochemical measurements 
All electrochemical measurements were carried out at RT in a standard three-electrode 
electrochemical cell using potentiostat Autolab (PGSTAT-302N) coupled with a rotating disc 
electrode (RDE) on fresh samples (unless otherwise stated). An Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl-filled) 
(EAgCl/Ag = 1.02 V vs. RHE) electrode and a glassy carbon plate were used, respectively, as 
reference and counter electrode. A 3 mm diameter glassy carbon (GC) disc was used as the 
working electrode substrate. The catalytic inks were prepared by dispersing 10 mg of catalyst 
powder in a mixture composed of ultra-pure water (500 µL), isopropanol (500 µL) and Nafion
®
 
(100 µL), followed by ultrasonication for 10 min. 3 μL of the dispersed catalyst were deposited 
onto the surface of the working electrode (catalyst loading of 0.38 mg cm
-2
) and the deposit was 
dried under N2 flow. 
The measurements were conducted in a N2 saturated 1 mol L
-1
 KOH (86.5%, VWR) aqueous 
electrolyte. Firstly, cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a nitrogen-saturated electrolyte from 
0.15 to 1.35 V vs RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s
-1
. Then the activity of catalysts towards HER 
was examined by recording linear sweep voltammograms from 0.5 to -0.6 V vs. RHE at a scan 
10 
 
rate of 5 mV s
-1
 by applying a rotating rate of 1600 rpm to the RDE. All measurements were IR-
drop corrected by determining the cell resistance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
measurements (EIS) between 0.1 Hz-100 KHz. Spectra were acquired in the capacitive region 
with a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface and an SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase 
analyser.  
3. Results and discussion 
All the here-investigated MXenes were synthesized from the same initial MAX phase, 
Ti3AlC2 powder, as precursor. The synthesis conditions of the different MXenes are summarized 
in Table 1 and the different separation/washing steps are described in the experimental part and 
depicted in Scheme 1.

Three different etching solutions were used. They are: 
i) HF with two different concentrations, viz. 10 and 48 wt.% (Table 1).  
ii) LiF/HCl. This method, first reported in 2014 [8], resulting in the in-situ formation of HF, was 
recently improved by Alhabeb et al [43], with the design of the MILD method (minimally 
intensive layer delamination) allowing the production of single, as well as large flakes with low 
amounts of structural defects. Beyond the fact that this method avoids using hazardous HF, the 
delamination of sheets is favored because of the simultaneous insertion of Li cations and water 
molecules between sheets during the etching step [47]. In the here reported work, the MILD 
conditions, i.e. exfoliation of Ti3AlC2 at 25 °C during 24 h, was reproduced (sample labelled 
Ti3C2-Li-24/25). For comparison, a harsher synthesis - 60 °C for 72 h, was investigated (sample 
labelled Ti3C2-Li-72/60 – Table 1). Increasing both etching temperature and duration was 
deliberate in order to exacerbate differences between their properties. 
iii) FeF3/HCl. As shown in our previous work [36], LiF can be substituted by iron fluoride, FeF3, 
as the etching agent. These samples - labelled Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 and Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 - were 
prepared using identical F/Al atomic ratios, temperatures and times (see Table 1) used for the 
Ti3C2-Li-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-72/60 samples, respectively. 
 
3.1 XRD characterization 
12 
 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different samples are plotted in Fig. 1. With one 
exception, all of the etching conditions resulted in the total loss of Ti3AlC2 peaks – at 2 of 9.54, 
19.18 and 38.92° (see Fig. S1 of ESI) - from the XRD patterns. For the Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 sample, a 
very small amount of unreacted MAX phase is observed. The absence of MAX phase peaks in 
the XRD patterns is taken as direct evidence for the total etching of Al. This result is further 
confirmed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. 
The ICP results reported in Table 2 clearly show that the highest number of Al per 3 Ti atoms is 
only of 0.08. Furthermore, according to the XRD patterns, and with one exception, we see no 
evidence for crystallized secondary phases, such as TiC, TiO2 or AlF3, that are sometimes 
observed. In the Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample the presence of TiC peaks was identified.

The XRD pattern of the Ti3C2-HF48 powders is similar to those previously reported using the 
same preparation conditions [33]. It is well-established that the substitution of Al by terminal 
groups during the etching step involves a shift of (00l) peaks of the initial MAX phase towards 
lower diffraction angles leading to higher c lattice parameter value (c = 18.5 Å for Ti3AlC2). The 
c parameter value of 19.9 Å obtained for the Ti3C2-HF48 material is the lowest value obtained 
herein, indicating that no water is intercalated between sheets for this material. For the Ti3C2-
HF10 powders, two (002) peaks can be clearly identified: a more intense one corresponding to a 
c parameter value of 19.9 Å and a less intense one corresponding to a c parameter value of 25.5 
  
14 
 
Å. The latter indicates the presence of some water between the sheets and is characteristic of the 
interstratification phenomenon observed in clay materials, as described in our previous work 
[46]. This hydration heterogeneity involves different layer-to-layer distances in the multilayer 
particle. The observation of two distinct peaks is also characteristic of partial segregation, i.e., 
wherein a succession of layers having the same hydration state is favored over a random one 
[46].  
As observed in Fig. S2, before the washing step (step 3 of Scheme 1), the Ti3C2-HF10 sample 
is mainly composed of stacks having an interlayer spacing leading to a c parameter value of 25.5 
Å (Fig. S2a) revealing higher amounts of water layers intercalated in the MXene structure. It is 
well-known that the presence of cations is required to stabilize water molecules between the 
sheets since the MXene surface is negatively charged  [35,46]. So, in the present case, it is very 
likely that H3O
+
 (coming from the acid of the etching agent) stabilizes the interlayer water 
molecules. The stabilization of water molecules with H3O
+
 was already reported [47]. The 
washing step, performed at low concentration - 0.5 g in 350 mL of deaerated water - has a crucial 
role for this sample since it removes these cations, probably by osmotic pressure, leading to a 
partial dehydration of the MXene. Consequently, washing results in a decrease in the c parameter 
value and the aforementioned segregation phenomenon is observed. In contrast, the XRD 
patterns of the Ti3C2-HF48 powders (Fig. S2c and d) evidence a negligible effect of the washing 
step on c. The c parameter at 19.9 Å does not evolve with washing, indirectly demonstrating the 
absence of water and cations between sheets. Thus, in contrast to the Ti3C2-HF48 sample, the 
Ti3C2-HF10 multilayers exhibit a real ability for the insertion of few water molecules between 
their sheets. Nevertheless, once the water layers are removed, it is not possible to increase again 
the d-spacing since no cations are present between the layers allowing their stabilization. 
15 
 
In the Ti3C2-Li-24/25 case, a separation step by centrifugation (step 3’ – Scheme 1) was 
required to obtain a MXene free from the initial MAX phase. A high fraction of unreacted MAX 
phase always remained in the sediment (see Fig. S3) and the complete separation of the MAX 
and MXene was difficult. It is for this reason that the fraction of obtained MXene for this etching 
protocol (≈ 0.1 g) is considerably smaller than the other methods (see Table 2). Nevertheless, as 
proposed by Alhabeb et al [43], the sediment can be reused to undergo the synthesis protocol. In 
comparison with the (002) peaks, the intensities of other (00l) peaks are so low that a higher 
magnification of the diffractogram is required to reveal them (Fig. S3b). The asymmetry of these 
(00l) peaks combined with the position of the (002) peak corresponding to a c parameter value of 
27.3 Å, value between 25 Å (one water layer) and 31 Å (two water layers), reveals a random 
distribution of interlayer spacing having one water layer or two water layers stabilized by the Li
+
 
cations [35,46], characteristic of interstratified MXenes [46].  
The XRD pattern of Ti3C2-Li-72/60 sample (Fig. 1) is close to that of Ti3C2-Li-24/25 sample 
with a c parameter value of 24.7 Å. As expected [8,36], both MXenes have intercalated water 
molecules between the sheets contrary to the Ti3C2-HF48 (19.9 Å) powders for which no water 
was present between the layers. It should be noted that a LiF impurity is sometimes observed in 
the XRD patterns (Fig. S3b). Nevertheless, the LiF amount is quite low as confirmed by the Li 
content determined from ICP analyses (Table 2). Finally, the use of harsher conditions (Ti3C2-Li-
72/60 material) makes it possible to obtain a higher amount of MXene (≈ 0.45 g – Table 2) in a 
one-pot synthesis compared to the Ti3C2-Li-24/25 sample and does not require an additional 
separation step (like in step 3’ of Scheme 1). 
For the FeF3-etched samples, the characteristic MXene diffraction are also observed and 
traces of the Ti3AlC2 phase are present for the Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 sample (Fig. 1e and f). 
16 
 
Interestingly, whereas the etching conditions are similar for Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-24/25 
samples, the etching of Al is clearly favored when FeF3/HCl is used since the fraction of 
unreacted MAX phase is quite low and the separation step (step 3’ of Scheme 1) is not required. 
Furthermore, the obtained MXene amounts in a one-pot synthesis is four times higher: 0.4 g and 
0.1 g for Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-24/25 samples, respectively (Table 2). Consequently, Al 
etching is not only due to the in-situ generated HF (the initial fraction of F is similar for both 
samples) but also the cations present. In this case, Fe also plays a major role in the etching 
process and this will be discussed in section 3.4 of this manuscript. The asymmetric shape of the 
XRD peaks obtained when Fe is used, also indicates an interstratification phenomenon. The c 
parameter values of 27.8 Å and 29.6 Å calculated for Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 and Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 
MXenes, respectively, are higher than those obtained when starting with HF or LiF in the etching 
solutions, suggesting the simultaneous insertion of water molecules and Fe cations between the 
MXene sheets. The amount of Fe present, however is quite low (Table 2) but previous works 
showed that a low amount of cations is enough to stabilize water layers (for example: 0.08 Mg 
for 3 Ti) [47].  
For the Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample, only 0.22 g of MXene was obtained, indicating that a 
significant amount of the MAX phase and/or the synthesized MXene dissolves during the 
process. At 0.45 g, the remaining MXene amount for the Ti3C2-Li-72/60 sample is more than 
double. Thus the FeF3-etching agent is significantly harsher and results in over-etching. The low 
amount of TiC observed as a secondary phase in the XRD pattern recorded for Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 
sample (Fig. 1) confirms the over-etching. Indeed, TiC is a small impurity in the initial MAX 
phase which is not affected during the etching process and thus remains after the synthesis. 
Except for Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample, the fraction of TiC in the global sample is very low and is not 
17 
 
detected by XRD. In contrast, for the latter, since a relative large fraction of MAX/MXene 
dissolves, the fraction of TiC in the global sample increases explaining why it is observed by 
XRD.   
 
3.2 Raman and XPS spectroscopies 
The XPS spectra of Ti 2p, O 1s, C 1s and F 1s of the different samples are plotted in Fig. 2 
and the fitting results are reported table S1 to S7. XPS is currently an essential tool to understand 
the surface chemistry of MXenes and several recent papers have reported on the spectral 
decomposition of the different photopeaks associated with MXenes [48–50]. As noted above, 
one of the aims of the present work is to provide a better methodology to decompose 
experimental XPS signals, thanks to the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx samples with different surface 
compositions, and to propose a better quantification of the terminal groups.  
18 
 
Fig. 2. XPS high resolution spectra of F 1s, O 1s, Ti 2p and C 1s regions for the different 
Ti3C2Tx samples whose labels are listed on right hand side.   
In the Ti 2p region, it is now well-established that the 3 doublets of asymmetric peaks 
centered at ca. 455.0 eV (only the first value of the doublet is reported here), 455.8 eV and 457.0 
19 
 
eV and labeled as Ti carbide, Ti
2+
 and Ti
3+
, respectively, are related to the MXene structure: C-
Ti-C in the core of the layer, C-Ti-O, C-Ti-F and C-Ti-OH corresponding to Ti atoms bonded to 
both C atoms and terminal groups. Nevertheless, the assignation of each peak to a specific bond 
is not clear since numerous discrepancies can be found in the literature [48–50]. Moreover, due 
to their closeness in terms of binding energy, the decomposition of the 3 peaks is not obvious 
since different combinations of peak positions and full width at half maxima (FWHM) can 
provide a good refinement while drastically changing the area ratio between peaks. Nevertheless, 
for quantification purposes, we can undoubtedly attribute these 3 contributions to MXene Ti 
atoms.  
In the pioneering XPS work done by Halim et al. [48], the Ti atoms bonded to F-terminal 
groups was shown to be responsible for the appearance of the band centered at ca. 460.0 eV. By 
correlating the area of this latter peak with the one of C-Ti-F in the F 1s spectra, the obtained 
F/Ti ratio is inconsistent (see Tables S2 to S7 and the F/Ti ratio determination in part III of ESI). 
For example, the F/Ti ratios of ≈ 11 and 7 are found for the Ti3C2-HF48 and Ti3C2-HF10 
samples, respectively. This is impossible since in the Ti3C2Tx formula group, x is considered to 
be 2 or less [48]. Moreover, the magnitude of this peak is similar for Ti3C2-HF48 and Ti3C2-
HF10 (table S2 to S3) whereas it is clear that Ti3C2-HF48 have more F terminal groups as 
discussed below. Thus, it is clear that F terminal groups contributions should be involved in the 
three above mentioned contributions assigned to the MXene Ti atoms as proposed by Schultz et 
al. [50] and Persson et al. [49]. The peak centered at ca. 460.0 eV and labelled in the present 
work as TiF3 is therefore herein attributed to the formation of a minor secondary phase, TiF3±x, 
formed during the etching process. To confirm this conclusion, we measured the Ti 2p region of 
20 
 
a commercial TiF3 powder. A peak was obtained at a B.E. of 460.5 eV (Fig. S4a) which is close 
enough to our 460.0 eV peak.  
Furthermore, the doublet at ca. 459.0 eV (Fig. 2 and table S2 to S7) in the Ti 2p region was 
assigned to the presence of TiO2-xF2x. In general, the peak corresponding to TiO2 is centered at 
ca. 458.8 eV [51]. However, the introduction of small amounts of F in this structure, resulting in 
TiO2-xF2x, leads to a shift of this peak towards higher B.E. values (ca. 459.1 eV) [51]. Thus, the 
oxidation observed for the different samples can be assigned to the formation of a TiO2-xF2x 
oxyfluoride. This comment notwithstanding, one cannot exclude that this shift toward a higher 
B.E. simply results from a stronger electronic interaction of TiO2 with the MXene conductive 
substrate.  
The magnitude of this contribution is particularly high for the Fe samples showing that these 
materials are the most oxidized ones (Fig. 2). Therefore, this photopeak can be safely assigned to 
an oxidation of the MXene surface resulting in the formation of a fluorinated TiO2 viz. TiO2-xF2x. 
Raman spectroscopy, discussed in the next section, confirms this conclusion. The fraction of 
oxidized Ti atoms was determined by calculating the ratio between the area of the peak 
corresponding to TiO2-xF2x (459.1 eV) and all peaks involving chemical bonds formed with the 
Ti atoms (Table 3).  
Peaks in the O 1s region were assigned based on reported studies [52]. The peaks centered at 
ca. 529.7-529.8 eV and at ca. 531.2-531.3 eV labelled as C-Ti-O (i) and C-Ti-O (ii) in our work 
can be attributed to –O terminal groups bonded to Ti atoms at two different crystallographic 
sites, previously described as bridging and A sites, respectively [50]. The peak at ca. 531.8-532.0 
eV can be ascribed to hydroxyl terminal group bonded to Ti atoms. Lastly, the peak centred at 
ca. 533.7-534.1 eV was attributed to water molecules (inserted between the atomic sheets or at 
21 
 
the surface of the multi-layered particles). The peak centered at ca. 530.6-530.8 eV is attributed 
to TiO2-xF2x. Importantly, the intensity of this peak increases as that of the peak attributed to 
TiO2-xF2x in the Ti 2p region also increases, particularly for the oxidized Fe samples, thus 
confirming our assignment. Finally, the contribution at ca. 533 eV corresponds to O bonded to 
adventitious carbon (labelled OR in Fig. 2) as proposed by Schultz et al. [50]. Nevertheless, we 
cannot exclude that a small fraction of this adventitious O is also present in the peak assigned to 
hydroxyl groups at ca. 531.8-532.0 eV. 
In the C 1s region, the peak at ca. 281.9 eV can be undoubtedly assigned to C-Ti-Tx moieties 
[48–50]. The others contributions (Table S2 to S7) are ascribed to the contamination of the 
MXene surface by the atmosphere [48,50]. Nevertheless, the high magnitude of the C-C 
contribution in the most oxidized samples (Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 and Ti3C2-Fe-72/60) can be also 
partly due to the formation of amorphous C during the etching process due to oxidation and over-
etching (Fig. 2). The formation of amorphous carbon during MXene oxidation process was 
already reported in the literature [53].   
In the F 1s region, the major contribution at ca. 685.0 eV can be assigned to C-Ti-F groups. 
Nevertheless, F atoms belonging to TiO2-xF2x and TiF3 compounds also contribute to this peak. 
Indeed, the F 1s peak for TiO2-xF2x is 684.6 eV [51]. We measured a B. E. of 685.1 eV for TiF3 
(Fig. S4a). The low intensity peak at 686.5 eV is probably related to an unknown fluorinated 
secondary phase or to F atoms directly bonded to MXene C atoms exposed due to the dissolution 
of some of Ti atoms. The others peaks at higher B.E can be assigned to the formation of F 
polymeric chains involving CF2 or CF3 groups [54]. As observed, this photopeak is present 
almost exclusively on MXenes prepared with the FeF3/HCl etching solution which are the most 
oxidized samples. This is not surprising since the oxidation process involves the breaking of Ti-
22 
 
C bonds allowing for the formation of fluorinated polymeric C chain thanks to the presence of F 
atoms in the etching environment.

Based on our aforementioned assignments of the various XPS peaks, a quantification of the 
MXene surface composition was attempted (Table 3) using the results of the fits reported in 
Tables S2 to S7. To this purpose, several assumptions were made: (i) F attributed to the unknown 
fluorinated phase was not considered as an integral part of the MXene, (ii) amount of F atoms 
bonded to Ti atoms in the TiF3 impurity was subtracted from the C-Ti-Fx contribution at 685 eV 
considering 3 F atoms for 1 Ti, the amount of Ti in TiF3 being deduced from the TiF3 
contribution centered at ca. 460.0 eV in the Ti 2p region (Fig. 2), (iii) F atoms belonging to the 
TiO2-xF2x moiety in the C-Ti-F contribution at 685 eV as well as adventitious O in the O 1s 
region and involved in the C-Ti-(OH)x groups were neglected, (iv) the low amounts of chlorine, 
Cl, atoms (Table S1) were ignored, even if some are terminal groups.   
Based on these different assumptions and taking into account the fittings uncertainties (close 
to 10%), the obtained results should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the obtained 
compositions of the different MXenes are logical (Table 3), validating our approach. Indeed, in 
23 
 
every case, a Ti/C ratio of 3/2 is obtained. As importantly, the global number of moles of T 
groups is close to 2 as expected [48]. It is worth noting here, quantification of the terminal 
groups for the FeF3-etched samples was too complicated and is thus not reported in Table 3. This 
was mainly due to the high degree of oxidation of these surfaces. Indeed, the fitting of the O 1s 
region was strongly impacted by the formation of oxygenated carbonaceous species caused by 
the corrosive etching. The high fraction of Ti oxyfluoride complicates the quantification of the F 
terminal groups since the x value in TiO2-xF2x could not be unambiguously determined. 
Nevertheless, the consistent Ti/C ratio, obtained from spectral decomposition of the Ti and C 
peaks indirectly confirms the validity of our peak assignments and the formation of MXenes with 
this etching agent.  
According to Table 3, the compositions obtained for the Ti3C2-HF10, Ti3C2-Li-24/25 and 
Ti3C2-Li-72/60 samples were quite close. The F-content of the Ti3C2-HF48 composition, on the 
other hand, was roughly double that of the other samples (Table 3 and Table S1). The higher 
amount of F atoms in the Ti3C2-HF48 sample is not surprising given the higher F content in the 
etching solution (Table 1) [6]. Somewhat surprisingly, the amount of F atoms in all Li-samples is 
close to that of the Ti3C2-HF10 samples despite the fact that almost twice as much F was used to 
synthesize the latter (Table 1).  
The fraction of hydroxyl groups among the oxygenated species is higher in the Ti3C2-HF48 
sample in comparison with Ti3C2-HF10, Ti3C2-Li-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-72/60 samples. As 
discussed below, this conclusion is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As already shown, the 
fraction of O/OH on the MXene surface depends on pH [55]. At low pH the favoured 
termination is OH; increasing the pH leads to dihydroxylation of the OH into O. Our synthesis 
was carried out under acidic conditions, favouring hydroxyl groups but the different steps of 
24 
 
centrifugation with water (see experimental part) increase the pH until 5 leading to a partial 
dihydroxylation and the formation of O terminal groups on the MXene surfaces as proposed by  
Natu et al [55]. Nevertheless, the dihydroxylation for Ti3C2-HF48 sample appears to be slower. 
As observed Fig. S2, after the centrifugation steps and before the washing step, water layer can 
be inserted between the layers for the Ti3C2-HF10 sample which is not the case for the Ti3C2-
HF48 sample. Thus, for the latter, the dihydroxylation, involving water molecules, is disfavoured 
[55]. Even if it is to a lesser extend for the Ti3C2-HF48 sample, this finding (table 3) confirms 
that O is favoured as terminal group in comparison with OH in our synthesis conditions and in 
agreement with studies reported by Persson et al. [49] and Hope et al. [56].  
Moreover, as previously mentioned, the F terminal groups are bonded preferentially on the A-
sites [49,50]. Thus, it is not surprising that, when the amount of F terminal groups increases as in 
the case of Ti3C2-HF48, a smaller fraction of O atoms are on the A-site (C-Ti-O (ii)). This result 
confirms our assignation and the theoretical work of the literature [49,50]. 
Finally, the fraction of oxidized Ti atoms (Table 3) indicates that the MXenes prepared with 
the FeF3/HCl etchant are highly surface oxidized and no significant difference was observed 
between both the two samples. This result further confirms that this etching agent is more 
corrosive than LiF/HCl etching agent as discussed in the XRD characterization section.

Fig. 3. Raman spectra of the as-synthesized MXenes. The spectra are shifted vertically for 
clarity. 
 
Raman spectra obtained for all samples are plotted in Fig. 3. According to the computational 
study of Hu et al. [57], there are several Raman active vibrational modes in the observed range 
for the three Ti3C2Tx with homogeneous terminal groups, namely Ti3C2O2, Ti3C2F2 and 
Ti3C2(OH)2, and the chemical nature of the terminal groups greatly affects the vibrational 
frequencies of the Raman modes. In Fig. 3, the positions of the calculated frequencies are 
indicated by doted lines and marked with an O, F or OH label, respectively for Ti3C2O2, Ti3C2F2 
and Ti3C2(OH)2. It can be seen that these calculated frequencies roughly match with the observed 
ones and that, except for the Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample, the different spectra are indicative of the 
26 
 
formation of Ti3C2Tx MXene. Indeed, deviations observed from the calculated values may be 
explained since calculations are based on Ti3C2T2 MXene with homogeneous terminations and 
only considering a monosheet [57]. 
The intensities of the two bands at 128 and 700 cm
-1
,
 
assigned to Ti3C2F2, were found to be 
relatively higher for the Ti3C2-HF48 sample than the others, confirming the higher F content in 
good agreement with the XPS analyses (Table 3 and S1). 
Based on the theoretical results of Hu et al. [57], the frequency associated with the out-of-
plane stretching vibration of surface Ti in bare Ti3C2 at 228 cm
-1 
is shifted to 218 and 208 cm
-1
, 
respectively with -OH or -O as terminal groups and to 190 cm
-1
 with -F as terminal groups. The 
position of this band in the spectra will be therefore greatly dependent on the relative abundance 
of the different terminal groups. In Fig. 3, the corresponding band is centered at about 212 cm
-1
 
for the Ti3C2-HF10 sample. For the F-rich sample (Ti3C2-HF48), a shoulder ≈ centered at 195 
cm
-1 
is clearly observed again consistent with the higher F content of this sample. Nevertheless, 
this band is also downshifted for samples prepared with the LiF/HCl etching agent, whereas the 
amount of F is close to that of Ti3C2-HF10 (Table 3). Lioi et al. [58] also observed the downshift 
of this band when comparing MXenes obtained using HF and LiF/HCl etching agents. They state 
that small changes in the relative abundance of the various Tx groups may have a strong effect in 
individual MXene sheets and therefore significantly affect the Ti-C bond lengths and 
consequently Raman modes. Inter-layer species (water, cations), present in the LiF etched 
samples, should also affect the electron density drawn from the Ti-C bonds resulting in 
harder/softer Raman modes. This Raman band (ca. 200 cm
-1
) was also shown to be affected by 
the restacking properties of the materials [59]. Besides, we cannot exclude that Cl atoms 
27 
 
observed in small amounts in LiF and FeF3-etched samples (Table S1) may also affect this out-
of-plane stretching vibration mode in the same way as F atoms do.  
The band intensity associated with the -O terminal groups (730 cm
-1
) increase as the HF 
concentration decreases indicating that more -O terminal groups are present.  The intensity of 
bands associated with the –OH terminal groups (622 and 285 cm
-1
) does not evolve significantly, 
however. Thus, the O/OH ratio of the Ti3C2-HF48 sample is lower than that of all other samples. 
This result is also in line with the XPS study and validates both our XPS and Raman 
assignments.   
The Raman spectra of both samples etched with the LiF/HCl solution are similar to the ones 
etched with 10% HF (Ti3C2-HF10) except for the already discussed shift of the band associated 
to the out-of-plane stretching vibration of surface Ti atoms (ca. 200 cm
-1
). This is also in 
agreement with the XPS data showing no significant differences between the surface 
compositions of these three samples (Table 3).  
Though the XRD patterns of the Fe-samples do not show the presence of crystallized TiO2, 
Raman and XPS spectroscopies clearly indicate the partial oxidation of these samples. Indeed, 
the formation of anatase TiO2 (or TiO2-xF2x) can be observed in the Raman spectra (Fig. 3), 
particularly for Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample. The Eg vibrational mode of pure anatase is at 143 cm
-1
 
[51]. Here, that mode is shifted to 158 cm
-1
, a shift that could be due to the presence of F in the 
anatase structure [51]. This conclusion is consistent with our XPS results. The fraction of TiO2-
xF2x increases under harsher etching conditions (Ti3C2-Fe-72/60).  
Referring to Fig. 3, the presence of the MXene spectral signature is clear for the Ti3C2-Fe-
24/25 material. For the visible Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample the intense TiO2-xF2x bands hide the 
MXene spectral footprint. It is also obvious that this oxidation process occurs primarily on the 
28 
 
surface of the MXene as evidenced previously from XPS since the high fraction of TiO2-xF2x at 
the surface is similar for both samples (Fig. 2 and Table 3) whereas the amount of TiO2-xF2x 
observed by Raman, with a greater depth of analysis, is clearly different (Fig. 3).  
Finally, a hump is also observed between 350 and 450 cm
-1
 for all Ti3C2Tx samples.  As 
reported by Hu et al [57], this can be explained by the heterogeneity of terminal groups. Indeed, 
using a simplified Ti3C2O(OH) monosheet model, two Raman active modes appear at 364 and 
387 cm
-1
 which match well with our results. We thus conclude, not unsurprisingly and in total 
agreement with previous work, that our MXenes have heterogeneous terminations, as observed 
from XPS results. Furthermore, the intensity of these bands seems to be strongly affected by the 
nature of terminal groups as the intensity of the band at ca. 364 cm
-1
 considerably increases with 
the F-content.  
 
3.3 Micro/macrostructure characterization 
The macrostructure of the MXene is also affected by the chemical composition of the etching 
agent. As shown by SEM analyses (Fig. S5), using a high HF concentration (Ti3C2-HF48) leads 
to multi-layers MXenes separated by large gaps (accordion-like structure) whereas at lower HF 
concentrations (Ti3C2-HF10) tightly stacked sheets are formed [43]. The exfoliation process 
performed using HF at high concentrations involves the formation of more macroscopic defects 
and thus well-separated multi-layers MXenes [43]. This is due to the formation of H2 gas from 
the reaction between Al and HF, this reaction being faster when the HF concentration increases 
thus contributing to expanding the structure. SEM pictures of Li-samples (Fig. S5) show the 
typical microstructure of a delaminated MXene after restacking during the filtration step [8]. 
Regardless of the synthesis conditions of the LiF-etched samples, these results point out that the 
29 
 
MILD method leads to easier delaminations. Indeed, the delamination can be performed by 
simply shaking the suspension.  
The general microstructure of FeF3-etched samples observed by SEM is similar to that of HF-
MXene (Fig. S4). Contrary to LiF-etched samples, here the delamination is not observed by 
simple manual shaking though the c parameter value is higher. Even if some flakes can be 
isolated by centrifugation as indicated in our previous work [36], this method does not allow for 
a facile delamination and formation of clays as in the case of LiF/HCl, probably due to surface 
oxidation. Previous works showed already that the spontaneous delamination in water is only 
possible with Li cations [47].  
From Raman spectroscopy, we concluded that the Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 material is highly oxidized. 
Using high magnification SEM images (Fig. 4) of that sample confirmed the presence of a large 
number of surface nanoparticles that are presumably TiO2 anatase. Such nanoparticles are not 
observed on the non-oxidized samples such as Ti3C2-HF10 (Fig. 4). The presence of these 
nanoparticles results in a significant increase in the specific surface area values determined by 
BET method - 75 m
2
 g
-1
 for Ti3C2-Fe-72/60, and between 2 and 15 m
2
 g
-1
 for the other samples 
(Table S8).  
EDS analyses were also undertaken on the different samples (Table S8). Taking into account 
the uncertainties concerning the quantification of light elements, the reported results only allows 
for a semi-quantitative analysis. The removal of Al in all samples deduced from ICP 
measurements (Table 2) is confirmed by EDS analyses. As observed by XPS (Table 3 and S1), a 
higher content of F is observed for Ti3C2-HF48 material compared to the other samples. In 
agreement with the XPS and Raman analyses, no major differences in compositions are observed 
between the Ti3C2-HF10, Ti3C2-Li-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-72/60 samples.  The presence of Cl atoms 
30 
 
in the MXene prepared with HCl in the etching solution is also confirmed. The O fraction in the 
FeF3-etched samples is significantly higher than for other samples due to the MXene oxidation, 
increasing accordingly to the fraction of TiO2-xF2x observed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The 
C fraction also increases, particularly for the Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample, confirming the formation of 
an amorphous C phase during etching as demonstrated by XPS analysis. Titanium atoms are 
indeed partly oxidized and dissolution takes place during the synthesis as stated previously, 
automatically increasing the fraction of C in the sample.

formation of small nanoparticles on the surface of the MXene sheets, b) Ti3C2-HF10 sample, at 
same magnification, showing the absence of nanoparticles. 
 
Comparing the behavior of the MXenes synthesized using the three different etching agents, 
only those etched with LiF/HCl allows for a spontaneous delamination by simply manually 
shaking an aqueous MXene suspension [47]. That is not say that the two LiF-etched samples 
were different. To highlight a difference, the powders were dispersed in water to form a colloidal 
suspension and drop-cast onto a SiO2/Si substrate for SEM observation (Fig. 5). From the SEM 
31 
 
images, major differences were observed, particularly concerning the lateral size of isolated 
flakes (or multi-layers flakes with few sheets). Indeed, the harsher etching conditions led to 
smaller flakes (with lateral sizes < 2 m) whereas the Ti3C2-Li-24/25 sample is composed of 
larger flakes (most with a lateral size between 2 and 10m).

backscattered electron imaging.

In addition to reducing the flake size, the harsh conditions (i.e. those corresponding to the 
synthesis of Ti3C2-Li-72/60) led to more disorganized stacks and defective sheets as evidenced in 
Fig. 6, where a TEM analysis of representative flakes is shown. Fig. 6a shows different TEM 
micrographs and corresponding energy-filtered electron diffraction patterns (EFEDP) acquired 
on different flakes. For most of the investigated zones (two of which are here given and labelled 
zones 1 and 2) the flake size is consistent with the SEM observations. In addition, the 
corresponding EFEDP evidences the disorganization of the sheets with diffraction spots arranged 
over rings characteristic of in-plane flake rotation with respect to each other. This is in contrast 
with zone 3, obtained in the same sample, where the flake is much larger and the EFEDP 
evidences well defined spots characteristic of the hexagonal symmetry (this kind of stack is 
largely in minority in this sample). This zone 3 is similar to those generally encountered in the 
Ti3C2-Li-24/25 sample, prepared with soft conditions. In addition to the disorder evidenced in 
the EFEDP, the C-K edge recorded in zones 1 and 2 shows a modification of the fine structure 
compared to the less perturbed zone 3. As evidenced in Fig. 6b, the A peak intensity is reduced, 
B peak is broadened and structures C and D are less pronounced in zones 1 and 2 compared to 
the C-K edge in zone 3, which is closer to the C-K edges recorded in samples obtained under 
softer etching conditions [60]. The broadening and intensity-loss observed in the fine structures 
spectra collected in zones 1 and 2, which are much more representative of most of the flakes than 
zone 3, is characteristic of structural disorder within the MXene sheets and evidences the effect 
of the harsh etching protocol on the structural quality of the flakes.

3.4 Summary of the different properties adjusted by the etching conditions 
Based on this study, it is clear that by varying the HF concentration in the etching agent, the 
surface properties as well as surface composition can be tuned. As shown by the XPS analyses 
performed on Ti3C2-HF10 and Ti3C2-HF48 samples, the amount of fluorine as terminal groups in 
the MXene can thus be controlled resulting in tunable ability to insert water between sheets as 
confirmed by XRD. Since -F terminal group is more hydrophobic than –OH and –O ones, this is 
consistent with the higher fluorine content in Ti3C2-HF48 that strongly limits the ability to 
intercalate water between sheets. This constitutes a major level in the optimization of MXenes 
for applications such as electrochemical devices, water treatment, catalysis or humidity sensors. 
Among the oxygen-based terminal groups, oxygen groups are favored when decreasing HF 
34 
 
concentration. So, the variation of the conditions in HF medium allow tuning the O/OH ratio as 
terminal groups which can be interesting for specific applications preferentially involving one 
particular speciation.  
Except for the presence of Li cations as well as a little amount of Cl in the LiF-etched 
MXenes, their composition is close to that of Ti3C2-HF10 sample, explaining why obtained 
Raman and XPS spectra are so similar. Nevertheless, the macrostructure of these three samples is 
quite different. Indeed, the Li-samples can be spontaneously dispersed and delaminated in water 
contrary to Ti3C2-HF10 [47]. This is certainly due to the presence of Li ions between the sheets 
whereas for Ti3C2-HF10 the washing step leads to a partial dehydration of the sample caused by 
the removal of cations inserted between the sheets during the etching step, thus disabling the 
delamination. As stated above, using the same initial LiF and HCl concentrations but different 
synthesis conditions - soft vs. harsh - results in the formation of MXenes with comparable 
compositions in general and similar terminal groups in particular (Table 3). However, when 
harsher etching conditions are used, they result in the formation of structural defects and smaller 
flakes. As discussed below, these defects greatly modify the surface properties of the samples. 
All else being equal (temperature, duration, fluorine to MAX ratio), the FeF3/HCl etching 
method leads to faster etching of Al compared to LiF/HCl etching. This method is thus of great 
interest when the efficiency of the etching process is the governing parameter in the synthesis of 
Ti3C2Tx materials. Moreover Li is a limited natural resource[61], whereas iron is the fourth most 
abundant element in the earth’s crust, which makes it more interesting from an industrial point of 
view. Furthermore, FeF3/HCl etching results in Ti3C2Tx@TiO2-xF2x composite in a one-pot 
synthesis. The MXene oxidation mechanism is closely related to the presence of Fe cations as Ti 
atoms in the MXene are oxidized by Fe cations during the synthesis. Indeed, if one assumes the 
35 
 
average charge of Ti atoms in Ti3C2Tx to be ≈ 2.4 [62], then the standard potential of the 
Fe
3+
/Fe
2+
 redox couple (E°Fe3+/Fe2+ = 0.77 V vs. SHE) is higher than that of Ti (E°Ti3+/Ti2+ = -0.37 
V vs. SHE and E°TiO(2+)/Ti3+ = +0.19 V vs. SHE). This oxidation probably favors the exfoliation 
step explaining why Al removal rate is higher compared to the samples synthesized using 
LiF/HCl as etching agent; despite similar synthesis conditions are used. Combining XPS and 
Raman results, it was shown that the oxidation was produced preferentially at the MXene sheet 
surfaces.  
In our previous work, FeF3/HCl was employed but at lower concentrations (initial F/Al 
atomic ratio equal to 7) [36] and no formation of TiO2 (or TiO2-xF2x) was observed using Raman 
spectroscopy. To confirm this result, a Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 sample was also synthesized in this work 
with two times less FeF3 in the etching solution (initial F/Al atomic ratio = 6) (See section V of 
ESI). In this case, a small amount of TiO2 (or TiO2-xF2x) is observed in the Raman spectra (Fig. 
S6) compared to the other Fe-samples. Thus, by varying the synthesis parameters such as FeF3 
concentration, temperature and duration, it is possible to control in a one-pot synthesis the 
fraction of TiO2, more accurately, an anatase-like TiO2-xF2x structure. Taking into account that 
these composites are increasingly studied for different applications such as photocatalysis [63], 
sensors [13], batteries [64,65] or supercapacitors [66], our simple and one-pot synthesis allows 
for the facile control of the fraction of oxidized phase. On the other hand, by combining the 
positions of the XPS photopeaks and Raman bands, it seems that the formed oxidized phase is an 
oxyfluoride with anatase-like structure rather than an oxide. 
 
3.5 Investigation the electrochemical behavior of MXenes 
36 
 
The voltammetric signatures of our MXenes were first investigated in a nitrogen-saturated 1 
mol L
-1
 KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s
-1
. The resulting cyclic voltammograms for 
Ti3C2-HF10, Ti3C2-HF48, Ti3C2-Li-24/25 and Ti3C2-Li-72/60 materials are presented in Fig. 7a. 
For theses samples, an irreversible oxidation peak centered at ca. 0.9 – 1.1 V vs. RHE is 
observed during the positive scan of the first voltammetric cycle. In the absence of redox active 
species in the electrolyte, this redox peak can be most assuredly assigned to the irreversible 
oxidation of Ti atoms in direct contact with the electrolyte [67] and disappears in the following 
cycles as showed for Ti3C2- HF48 sample (Figure S8). This electrochemical response was found 
not to depend on the synthesis conditions since this intense oxidation peak was observed for all 
MXenes except for the Fe-samples (Fig. 7b and c). Indeed, the intensity of the irreversible 
oxidation peak for Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 (Fig. 7b) is much lower than those observed for the other 
confirming once again that this material was partly oxidized prior to voltammetric 
measurements. This decrease in intensity is even higher for Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 material (Fig. 7c), 
that is to know for the most oxidized sample, showing that this methodology is well-adapted to 
characterize the MXene surface oxidation. It is worth noting that the cyclic voltammograms 
obtained with FeF3-etched samples have the typical I(E) behavior of materials possessing low 
electronic conductivities. The high oxide content of these samples probably strongly reduces 
their conductivity.

The activity of the different MXenes towards HER was investigated by recording a 
polarization curve at a scan rate of 5 mV s
-1
. HER is here used as a probe to shed light on the 
surface chemical stated of the MXenes. Fig. 7d summarizes our results and the obtained HER 
kinetic parameters are listed in Table 4. As observed, among the different studied MXenes, 
Ti3C2-Li-72/60 is the best catalyst for this reaction since both the overpotential (344 mV) and 
38 
 
Tafel slope (96 mV dec
-1
 ) are the lowest (Table 4). Focusing on the HF-etched samples, the 
HER activity of Ti3C2-HF10 is higher than the Ti3C2-HF48 material, the worst catalyst. These 
results are in agreement with the work of Handoko et al. [6] suggesting that the HER activity of 
MXene surfaces can be inhibited by the presence of terminal F atoms. The HER activity indeed 
decreases with the increase of F/Ti atomic ratio (Table 3). As discussed below, the F content is 
not systematically the main parameter which affects HER activity.  
Focusing now on the Li-samples, Ti3C2-Li-72/60 MXene is largely better as an electrocatalyst 
for HER than Ti3C2-Li-24/25 (Table 4). Taking into account the similarity between the chemical 
compositions for these Li-containing samples (Table 3), this huge difference concerning HER 
activity cannot be solely related to the F content. In general, the experimental determination of 
the nature of the involved active site for HER is quite difficult. Nevertheless, the formation of 
smaller flakes (more exposed edges and corners,…) and more structural defects (as showed by 
TEM/EELS analyses) with Ti3C2-Li-72/60 sample change the nature of the active sites compared 
to Ti3C2-Li-24/25 explaining the difference in HER activities. As an example, Natu et al. showed 
that the charges of MXenes edges and surfaces are different [55], which can potentially drive to 
difference in the –OH adsorption kinetics for HER reactions.  
HER activities of the Fe-samples (Fig. 6) are also relatively low in comparison with Ti3C2-Li-
72/60 material. This is associated with both the surface oxidation and the low electronic 
conductivity.  This is confirmed by the very low Tafel slopes of these samples compared to other 
MXenes. The lower activity of Ti3C2-Fe-72/60 compared to Ti3C2-Fe-24/25 can be ascribed to a 
higher fraction of oxidized Ti atoms. The role of oxidation on HER activity is further discussed 
below. 
39 
 
Focusing now on gravimetric capacitance (see ESI part VI for methodology), it is clear that 
Ti3C2-Li-24/25 sample is the most interesting among all materials with a gravimetric capacitance 
of 180 F g
-1
 (table 4) indicating that MXene with larger flakes exhibit a higher capacitance as 
already reported by Peng et al. [68]. The high degree of oxidation of the FeF3-etched samples 
precluded our measuring their capacitances. 
To summarize, the synthesis conditions have a crucial role on electrochemical performances. 
As an example, the synthesis conditions (soft and harsh) applied using the LiF/HCl etching agent 
have a dramatic impact on surface properties of the resulting MXene though the chemical 
compositions are very similar. Soft synthesis condition favors a higher gravimetric capacitance 
by producing larger flakes containing a lower defect density. These materials can be used for 
applications such as supercapacitors, whereas harsh conditions favor the production of MXenes 
that are more active for the HER. The choice of the synthesis method is thus crucial and greatly 
depends on the targeted application.

3.6 Correlation oxidation/HER/XPS 
To confirm the role of surface oxidation on HER performances, the HER activity of Ti3C2-
HF48 was also measured after the irreversible surface oxidation occurring at around 1 V vs. RHE 
(potential cycling from -0.6 to 1.35 V vs. RHE) and compared with HER obtained after potential 
cycling from -0.6 to 0.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. 8), that not result in surface oxidation. As observed, the 
irreversible oxidation process leads to a significant decrease in the activity of MXene towards 
HER. Thus, oxidized MXene surfaces are not favorable for the HER.

oxidation at a scan rate of 5 mV s

electrolyte. 
 
Previous work showed that MXene surfaces are oxidation sensitive particularly under a wet 
atmosphere [36,69]. This behavior was used to confirm the role of Ti oxidation on HER activity. 
To further explore this aspect we studied the influence of storage conditions on MXene surface 
oxidation for the Ti3C2-HF10 and Ti3C2-HF48 samples. To do so, the fractions of oxidized Ti 
atoms of the fresh samples were compared with those of samples stored for one month either in a 
41 
 
glove box under dry nitrogen (samples labelled as Ti3C2-HF10-N2 and Ti3C2-HF48-N2), or under 
ambient air (labelled as Ti3C2-HF10-air and Ti3C2-HF48-air).  
Interestingly and irrespective of the storage conditions, the XRD pattern as well as the F 
contents - as determined by XPS - are similar to those of the initial samples. This is not 
surprising since MXenes powders are known to be relatively stable at a macroscopic scale as 
compared with MXene dispersed into a colloidal aqueous suspensions [70,71]. Nevertheless, the 
fraction of oxidized Ti atoms can be partly affected by the storage conditions. The high 
resolution XPS spectra of the Ti 2p region for the different samples are compared in Fig. 9. As 
observed, the fraction of oxidized Ti atoms at the surface is nearly the same for both fresh 
samples (≈ 10%). After storage under N2 and air atmospheres, the oxidation rate increases for 
Ti3C2-HF10, particularly under air (18.7%) whereas this rate does not evolve significantly for 
Ti3C2-HF48 samples. Thus, it can be deduced that the higher the F-content, the more stable the 
material is vis-a-vis oxidation after a month of storage.  
The better stability of Ti3C2-HF10 material under a dry N2 atmosphere in comparison with air 
is most probably related to the air humidity confirming already reported studies [36,69]. These 
different results are correlated with HER activity measurements. Indeed, as can be seen in Fig. 9, 
HER activity of the different Ti3C2-HF48 samples remains nearly constant, whereas the activity 
of the Ti3C2-HF10 samples decrease as the fraction of oxidized Ti atoms increases.  
This result confirms that HER activity is intimately related to the surface oxidation state of 
samples and can thus be used as an accurate probe to characterize the state of oxidation of Ti3C2 
surfaces. The decrease in the HER activity as the surface oxidation state is more pronounced is 
most likely related both to a decrease in the electronic conductivity of the MXene and to a 
42 
 
chemical modification of the active sites for HER, leading to an increase in the charge transfer 
resistances.  
Interestingly, the oxidation of the MXene surface can be partly avoided by an increase of the 
F-content for one month of storage duration. This is probably associated to the fact that this 
MXene is the only one of this work unable to insert water between MXene sheets, as evidenced 
by previously discussed XRD results. The few water inserted between sheets of interstratified 
Ti3C2-HF10 material (Fig. 1a), i.e. the main species responsible for MXene oxidation [69], can 
lead to a partial surface oxidation even during storage under a dry N2 atmosphere.  
Thus, to use MXenes as catalysts or active support for applications involving HER, 
controlling the oxidation kinetics is required. The balance between activity, higher for MXene 
with low F-contents and stability - which is better when water is not inserted between the sheets 
– is thus an important consideration that has to generally be taken into account.

4. Conclusions 
In this study, the role of the etching agent on the modification of surface chemistries and 
properties of Ti3C2Tx was explored. Three different etching agents were investigated: HF, 
LiF/HCl and FeF3/HCl, each of them under both soft and harsh conditions. We showed that these 
etching agents lead to different surface chemistries and some properties. 
Varying the HF concentration allows for varying the F content and consequently the ability 
to insert water. It was show that a low HF concentration allows the insertion of water layers 
probably stabilized by H3O
+
. Nevertheless, the washing on this sample, a crucial step for MXene 
synthesis, involves an irreversible decrease of the inserted water amount. The HF concentration 
also allows modifying the distribution of terminal groups (O/OH ratio) as well as the stability 
against surface oxidation. Each of these surface chemistries is interesting for various 
applications. For example, at lower HF concentrations, the formation of MXenes with a higher 
activity is favoured probably due to its lower F content. At higher HF concentrations the stability 
against oxidation is favoured for at least one month.   
Etching with LiF/HCl results in producing conductive clays facilitating the processing of 
these materials. Soft etching conditions - low temperatures and durations - led to the formation of 
Ti3C2Tx with large flakes and high capacitances. If the etching conditions are harsh (high 
temperature and duration) the resulting flakes are small and more defective leading to an 
enhanced HER activity.  
When the LiF is replaced by FeF3, the kinetics of the MAX to MXene transformation is 
enhanced, even when the initial F/Al ratio is the same, thanks to the oxidation properties of Fe
3+
, 
which is interesting to reduce the global cost of the MXene production.  On the other hand, this 
45 
 
method do not allow a spontaneous delamination in water as in the case of LiF/HCl etching 
method.  
This method allows also the formation of Ti3C2Tx@TiO2-xF2x powders. The tuning of the 
synthesis parameters (temperature, duration, Fe concentration) allows for the control of the 
amount of TiO2-xF2x formed during synthesis. This oxyfluoride compound have the anatase 
structure. Producing this kind of composite with controlled composition in a one-pot synthesis is 
interesting for numerous applications such as photocatalysis and batteries. 
By contrast, this work highlights that MXene surface oxidation should be avoided for HER 
application. 
Thus, the synthesis parameters, even using a same etching agent solution, can have a 
significant impact on the surface properties. For all the above-mentioned reasons, this work 
could serve as a guideline for the MXene community to help in choosing the appropriate etching 
agent to obtain the desired physicochemical properties required for any targeted application.  
Undoubtedly, the exploration of these wonderful new materials and the future improvements 
in synthesis methods are still in their infancy and other remarkable properties may be discovered, 
further expending the range of potential applications.  
Another major aim of this work was to improve our understanding of XRD, Raman and XPS 
signals obtained on Ti3C2Tx. This was possible thanks to the sensitive tuning in surface 
composition, ability to insert water, oxidation, over-etching, amorphous carbon formation and 
macrostructural properties provided by the study of different etching agents. This study validates 
different theoretical and experimental studies on XPS and Raman spectroscopy provided in the 
literature to characterize these materials possessing a high degree of chemical complexity. 
Beyond the confirmation of the composition evolution based on XPS analyses, we show in this 
46 
 
study that Raman spectroscopy is a simple and powerful tool to characterize the MXene terminal 
groups. Finally, we showed that HER can be also an accurate surface probe to characterize 
surface properties of MXenes in addition to conventional methods. In brief, we believe that this 
work can also serve as a guideline for the MXene community of suitable characterization tools 
for an in-depth understanding of MXenes surface chemistry.

ABSTRACT 
Data-driven model interpretability is a requirement to gain the 
acceptance of process engineers to rely on the prediction of a data-
driven model to regulate industrial processes in the ironmaking 
industry. In the research presented in this paper, we focus on the 
development of an interpretable multivariate time series forecasting 
deep learning architecture for the temperature of the hot metal 
produced by a blast furnace. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
based architecture enhanced with attention mechanism and guided 
backpropagation is proposed to accommodate the prediction with a 
local temporal interpretability for each input. Results are showing 
high potential for this architecture applied to blast furnace data and 
providing interpretability correctly reflecting the true complex 
variables relations dictated by the inherent blast furnace process, 
and with reduced prediction error compared to a recurrent-based 
deep learning architecture.

1 Introduction and background 
Deep learning models have recently brought large expectation for 
different applications in artificial intelligence. Those models have 
an inherent capability to capture complex relations between large 
number of variables, structured and unstructured, temporal and/or 
spatial [1, 2]. The emergence of IoT solutions to monitor an 
industrial process is generating an enormous quantity of time series 
data.  As an illustration, in the ironmaking industry, the number of 
sensors for a blast furnace is several thousands, with sensors 
measuring temperatures, pressures, flows, chemical contents, etc. 
Analyzing properly those multivariate time series is bringing deep 
insight about the process itself, triggering understanding for 
corrective actions to be taken in order to optimize the process, and 
to reach production key performance indicators (KPIs). For that 
purpose, deep learning models for hot metal temperature forecast 
have been developed to guide the blast furnace operator to take 
appropriate decisions for optimal thermal regulation of the blast 
furnace [3]. However, to bring the data scientist and the process 
engineer to a certain level of confidence to deploy and use in 
production a data driven model predicting the evolution of the hot 
metal temperature, insight about variables having a high 
importance for each prediction is required. Indeed, this is often the 
first major obstacle to reach the successful acceptance by the 
process expert to rely on data driven model for improved process 
regulation and leading the journey towards higher level of 
automation in the ironmaking industry.  
Recurrent-based deep learning models are designed to process 
multivariate time series data having complex temporal and inter 
time series non-linear relations. For a blast furnace, each input 
variable has a different reaction time on the hot metal temperature 
to predict due to the high inertia of the underlying process. Those 
temporal shifts in the dataset are temporally dynamic as they also 
depend on the current operation of the blast furnace, which 
increases the level of complexity to capture causal relations in 
multivariate time series. Recurrent deep learning models have a 
dedicated architecture allowing them to model those dynamic 
causal relations but are acting as black box. Therefore, it is not 
possible to interpret the predictions of such a model that would 
require accessing the information about variables and 
corresponding temporal shifts that have been important to generate 
each single prediction. This inherent black box characteristic of 
deep learning models is the price to pay today to develop predictive 
models with better accuracy compared to conventional machine 
learning approaches, some being interpretable such as CART [4] or 
linear Regression. The need to open the box of deep learning 
models has created a new research field, where the research 
community is investing considerable efforts to develop 
interpretable deep learning model [5]. 
Deep learning model for time series interpretability has been 
however covered in only few papers. Two approaches are usually 
proposed in the literature: model-agnostic or model-specific 
interpretability. In the model-agnostic approach, a dedicated post-
analysis of a trained model is performed by generating 
perturbations in the training data [6], by calculating Shapley values 
[7], or by analyzing gradient propagation in a network [8]. The 
model-specific category is aiming at building attention mechanism 
directly embedded in the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
architecture. The attention mechanism is contributing to improve 
 C. Schockaert et al. 
 
 
 
the model accuracy by enhancing using dynamic weight, only 
relevant information in the recurrent hidden states [9, 10, 11, 12]. 
Indeed, recurrent networks tend to be less sensitive to pattern 
occurring far from the current time, which reduces their 
performances and is known as the vanishing gradient. An 
improvement to this issue has been brought with LSTM where the 
recurrent cell architecture is containing a forget gate triggering a 
forget mechanism for each input time series, and that is learnt from 
the training data. The memory is therefore dynamic, and adaptive 
for each input time series. The attention mechanism is bringing the 
improvement of LSTM to a higher level as it is learning to focus, 
for each input time series in a temporal window, on past time ranges 
relevant to make a prediction [11, 12, 14]. Attention mechanism is 
very popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for translation 
quality improvement [15]. By analyzing the attention of a recurrent 
architecture, it is possible to understand where the model is 
focusing its attention to generate a prediction, therefore it enables 
to interpret temporally any predictions provided by a recurrent 
model [16, 17].  
The proposed approach in this paper has been developed to 
answer the need to understand the predictions of the hot metal 
temperature from a blast furnace by a multivariate time series 
recurrent deep learning model. Due to the complex temporal and 
inter time series relations, several requirements are defined for the 
interpretability of the predictions: 
• Local interpretability: each prediction must be explained 
• Spatial interpretability: importance of each input variable 
for the prediction 
• Temporal interpretability: for each input variable, time 
location in the recent history where values for that variable are 
important for the prediction. The time location for each input 
variable is corresponding to the temporal shift inherent to the blast 
furnace process characterized by a high inertia. 
Those requirements have been covered by very few 
architectures available today in the literature. A CNN-based 
approach has been proposed in [16] where a Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) trained on multivariate time series data, is 
providing spatio/temporal interpretability by implementing grad-
CAM [18] to generate saliency maps. However, this solution is not 
improving the predictive performance of the CNN model, on the 
contrary to attention mechanism for a recurrent-based model. In 
[19], a modified internal structure of LSTM is investigated and 
aiming at simultaneously improving the model performance and 
achieving model spatio/temporal interpretability. An attention-
based approach for recurrent models has been proposed in [20] 
targeting the improvement and interpretability of the predictions. 
An attention mechanism is implemented to compute weights for the 
input features, as well as a second temporal-based attention on a 
LSTM model. The RETAIN model [14] brakes also the tradeoff 
between accuracy and interpretability of recurrent models by 
implementing a two-level neural attention model. 
Our approach is based on the implementation of the attention 
mechanism in a LSTM architecture trained to predict the hot metal 
temperature produced by a blast furnace. Our contribution is the 
implementation of a dynamic attention mechanism for multivariate 
time series providing temporal interpretability of predictions as 
well as a spatial interpretability without introducing unnecessary 
additional parameters. The prediction interpretability is local as 
depending on the learnt context captured by the dynamic attention 
mechanism and characterizing the time changing operation of the 
blast furnace. A temporal attention for each prediction can be 
directly extracted from the state-of-the-art implementation of 
attention mechanism for time series. However, for our model to 
handle multivariate time series, a dedicated guided 
backpropagation has been implemented to derive the temporal 
attention for each individual input time series. This feature is 
motivated by the second and third requirements: to provide spatial 
and temporal interpretability. 
In order to validate the interpretability provided by the 
spatio/temporal attention locally available for each prediction, an 
artificial dataset has been generated. This dataset is defined to 
reflect the main characteristics of the blast furnace data, namely a 
reaction time of some input time series on the target to predict, and 
therefore inducing temporal shifts in the dataset, but also variables 
having different level of correlation with the target.  
In the next section, the deep learning architecture of the 
proposed approach is described. Results are presented on an 
artificial dataset, as well as on actual data from a blast furnace. 
Conclusion and perspectives of this research are discussed. 
2 Description of the proposed approach and 
results 
The temporal local attention mechanism presented in this paper 
is implemented by the architecture in Figure 1. The n input time 
series are augmented by time series generated by a one-dimensional 
convolutional layer (conv1d) in order to learn relevant 
transformation of the n time series. That architecture is then 
featuring a LSTM layer that is generating one hidden state hi for 
each time step i in [t-w,…, t] of the multivariate time series X 
concatenated with the output of conv1d, in a time window of size 
w. A dynamic temporal attention is applied to w-1 previous hidden 
states and the context vector vt is calculated as described in Figure 
1. The dense layer of the attention mechanism bloc learns the 
context defined locally by the n time series denoted by X. This 
context can be a specific operation mode of the blast furnace. 
Learning the context allows to generate dynamic attentions weigths 
α={ αt-w, αt-w+1, …, αt-1 }, providing a local temporal interpretability 
for the prediction ypred,t+horizon. 
A dense layer generates a prediction ypred,t+horizon for the hot 
metal temperature at a horizon of 3h using as input the 
concatenation of the current hidden state ht and the context vector 
vt. 
A guided backpropagation-based approach is applied for each 
time step t between each input hidden state hai modified by the 
attention mechanism, and the original input vector xi where i is in 
[t-w, …, t]. The objective is to highlight which time series in the 
input vector xi is inducing a gradient in the hidden state hai.

Figure 1: Multivariate time series local spatio/temporal 
attention mechanism architecture 
The first validation of the proposed architecture is achieved with 
an artificial dataset. The objective of that validation is to ensure that 
the spatio/temporal attentions defined in that dataset are correctly 
identified. The simulated data are multivariate time series 
composed of four time series being inter-correlated, some with fix 
temporal shift, and one time series is uncorrelated to others. The 
following time series have been defined for creating this artificial 
dataset: 
Time series A: 𝐴(𝑡) 
Time series B: 𝐵(𝑡) = 𝛼 ∗ 𝐴(𝑡 − 3ℎ) 
Time series C: 𝐶(𝑡) = 𝛽 ∗ 𝐵(𝑡) 
Time series D: 𝐷(𝑡) = 1450 
The signal 𝐴(𝑡) is generated to randomly change its amplitude in a 
range of time [0, 3h]. When a change of amplitude is triggered, the 
amplitude itself is randomly changing in a range ±[5, 50]. The 
transition period of 𝐴(𝑡)  is linear when a random amplitude 
modification occurs. Figure 2 illustrates this artificial data set. The 
attention-based architecture described in Figure 1 is trained on 
10000 generated samples with a simulated time granularity of 1 
minute, and using a time window of size w = 500 minutes. The 
parameters 𝛼 and 𝛽 are respectively 0.1 and 0.5 with 1450 as initial 
value for 𝐴(𝑡). The model predicts the time series 𝐵(𝑡) from the 
other time series with a horizon of 3h. Figure 2a,b present the global 
temporal and spatial attentions calculated by averaging the local 
corresponding attentions over the training period. Figure 2c,d,f 
show the local attentions for a window of 500 minutes where a 
higher attention on  𝐴(𝑡) has been correctly identify on two past 
gradients in order to make a prediction of 𝐵(𝑡 + 3ℎ) which is as 
expected from the definition of the artificial dataset. The last row 
corresponding to the uncorrelated time series 𝐷(𝑡)  has low 
attention without any gradient validating that no specific attention 
should be put on that time series. Figure 2e illustrates the evolution 
of 𝐵(𝑡) and its prediction.

Results on actual data are presented in Figure 4, where the 
model has been trained on a period of 10 months, and with n=48 
input times series being continuous process variables measured at 
the blast furnace. The recurrent architecture is trained with a time 
window of size w = 500 minutes and that corresponds to the 
maximum reaction time of one variable to the hot metal 
temperature. The global temporal and spatial attention on the 
training period are illustrated in Figure 4a,b. This provides a 
signature of the model by understanding where it has put its 
attention in average during the training process, and therefore 
provides to the data scientist the timewise variable importance. The 
local temporal and spatial attention, are presented in Figure 4c,d. 
Those results are showing temporal and spatial attentions that are 
in line with known causal and correlation relations of the 
underlying blast furnace process. 
The prediction error of the attention-based architecture is 
compared with the state-of-the-art implementation of a recurrent 
model, a Vanilla LSTM configured similarly to the attention-based 
architecture of this paper: same training period, same time window 
size w, same horizon of prediction. For that purpose, the Root Mean

Square Error (RMSE) of both models is calculated on one month 
of data, and results are summarize in Figure 4f. As expected, the 
attention-based architecture is improving the RMSE of a standard 
LSTM without attention mechanism. However, improving the 
RMSE is not the main objective of this research focused merely on 
the interpretability of the model.

3 Conclusion and perspectives 
Our results are showing a high potential in using attention 
mechanisms for local spatio/temporal interpretability of a 
multivariate time series model for the temperature prediction of the 
hot metal produced by a blast furnace. The attention is clearly 
highlighting the complex spatio/temporal relation between process 
variables and the hot metal temperature. Indeed, temporal shifts 
between actuators and hot metal temperature are resulting from the 
high inertia of the process in a blast furnace. This is confirmed by 
a dedicated validation performed on an artificial dataset that is 
defined to include the main features present in the blast furnace 
process data.  
The prediction error of the attention-based model is compared 
with a Vanilla LSTM for the hot metal temperature prediction, by 
calculating the RMSE on one month of test data, which showed 
improvement by 12%. Although the initial motivation is to propose 
a new architecture with attention mechanisms, ensuring that our 
requirements for interpretability are met (local and spatio/temporal 
interpretability), improving the attention-based architecture to 
reduce further the prediction error is the objective for the next phase 
of this research. For that purpose, specific investigation is required 
by using convolutional layers potentially in combination with 
autoregressive filters, and to design specific filters in collaboration 
with process experts, taking into account the physicochemical 
nature of the reactions happening in a blast furnace. New encoder-
decoder-based architectures will be also researched to that end.

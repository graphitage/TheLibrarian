DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
Abstract 
 
Mean-modulated flicker -- wherein luminance increments and decrements of equal magnitude 
are applied, over time, to a test field -- is commonly used in both clinical assessment of vision 
and experimental studies of visual systems. However, presenting mean-modulated flicker on 
computer-controlled displays is problematic; displays typically introduce luminance artifacts to 
flickering stimuli, especially at high flicker frequency or contrast, potentially interfering with the 
validity of findings. Here, we present a battery of tests that we used to judge the suitability of 
displays for presenting mean-modulated flicker. These tests revealed marked differences 
between a new high-performance liquid-crystal display (LCD; EIZO ColorEdge CG247X) and a 
new consumer-grade LCD (Dell U2415b), despite the displays’ vendor-supplied specifications 
being almost identical. We measured displayed luminance using a spot meter, and a linearized 
photodiode device to record displayed luminance waveforms. We derived several measures, 
including spatial uniformity, response times, Fourier amplitude spectra, cycle-averaged 
luminance, and root-mean-squared luminance. We presented paired luminance pulses to 
quantify the displays’ nonlinear dynamics at high-contrast and high frequency. The CG247X 
showed relatively good spatial uniformity. Fourier transformation of nominally static test patches 
revealed spectra free of artifacts, with the exception of a frame response, that is, artifactual 
flicker related to the display refresh (here, 60 frames per second). The CG247X’s response 
times depended on both source and destination luminance, as is to be generally expected from 
LCDs. Despite this nonlinear behaviour, we were able to define a contrast and frequency range 
wherein the CG247X was artifact-free, that is, the relationship between nominal luminance and 
displayed luminance was accurately modelled using a causal, linear time-invariant system. This 
range included contrasts up to 80%, and flicker frequencies up to 30 Hz. This battery of tests

should prove useful to others conducting clinical assessment of vision and experimental studies 
of visual systems.

Introduction 
 
Many clinical assessments and experimental studies of visual systems use flickering stimuli, 
specifically, mean-modulated flicker wherein luminance increments and decrements of equal 
magnitude are applied, over time, to a test field, maintaining the field’s time-averaged 
luminance. For example, loss of visual function associated with glaucoma -- a condition 
affecting 3.5% of 40 to 80 year-olds [1] wherein loss of retinal nerve fibres leads to loss of vision 
-- can be revealed by measuring a patient’s behavioural responses to mean-modulated flicker 
(so-called flicker-defined-form perimetry) [2, 3]. Examples of experimental studies involving 
human participants include the use of mean-modulated flicker to quantify temporal visual 
sensitivity [4], to selectively probe putative magno- and parvocellular visual pathways [5, 6], as 
well as to measure steady-state visual evoked potentials (reviewed by Norcia and colleagues 
[7]) and to determine retinotopic maps in cortex [8, 9]. 
 
Traditionally, vision researchers and clinicians have presented mean-modulated flicker (as well 
as other dynamic visual stimuli) on computer-controlled cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays. These 
displays, although far from perfect, can be used to render a wide variety of dynamic stimuli. The 
behaviour of CRT displays has been discussed in detail in the clinical and experimental vision 
literature [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and, as a result, CRTs are usually employed in the 
clinic or laboratory in such a way that their imperfections do not interfere with the validity of 
findings. But CRT displays are now difficult to source, largely because of their recent, 
widespread replacement by liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in consumer-grade settings, forcing 
vision researchers and clinicians, in turn, to replace aged CRT displays with LCDs. LCDs are 
not without their own idiosyncratic behaviours as regards rendering dynamic stimuli. However, 
p. 4 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
comparatively little has been written about LCDs with the requirements of vision researchers 
and clinicians in mind. In the Discussion, we will review studies that have done so, comparing 
those results to our own. 
 
The mechanism governing the display of light by LCDs is markedly different from that of CRT 
displays. In CRT displays, frames are rendered by an electron beam raster-scanned over a 
screen containing light-emitting phosphor [18]. The increase and decrease of luminescence of 
activated phosphor (i.e., the phosphor response) is fast (on the order of 1 ms) relative to the 
rate of scanning (typically between 60 and 120 frames per second). On a given frame, the 
luminosity of a given point is controlled by modulating the beam current. From the point of view 
of the vision researcher or clinician, this mechanism confers many desirable behaviours to the 
CRT display, including temporal independence of luminosity from one frame to the next, even 
when rendering high-frequency flicker; because the phosphor response is fast, the luminosity at 
a point in one frame has little effect on the luminance at that point on the subsequent frame. 
However, a consequence of this mechanism is that all stimuli rendered by CRTs are 
contaminated with spatially structured, high-contrast flicker at the display’s frame rate. CRT 
flicker is imperceptible under most viewing conditions because it exceeds the critical 
flicker-fusion frequency [4, 19, 20], however, it activates the early visual pathway in humans, 
non-human primates, and cats [21, 22], and, presumably, other experimental animal models. 
 
LCDs comprise a spatial array of pixels, each pixel comprising a pair of electrodes, and 
polarizing filters that sandwich a column of liquid crystal (LC) material [23] (for a concise 
description of the LCD mechanism aimed at vision researchers and clinicians see Elze & Tanner 
[24]). The orientation of aligned LC molecules comprising the column determines the amount of 
p. 5 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
light transmitted by the backlight unit to the observer; voltage applied between the electrode pair 
in turn applies torque to molecules, which in turn alters the molecules’ orientation. A key 
observation is that these changes in orientation are sluggish relative to changes in voltage. 
Furthermore, changes in orientation are asymmetric: changes involving an increase in torque on 
molecules have different temporal dynamics to those involving a torque decrease [25]. These 
asymmetric dynamics are further complicated by digital response time compensation 
mechanisms, a feature of most modern LCDs designed to enhance video by accelerating step 
transitions between certain luminance levels [25, 26, 27, 24]. These LCD mechanisms confer 
many desirable behaviours to displays, including the independence of neighbouring pixels [28, 
29]. However, it follows from these mechanisms that, in general, LCDs cannot be used to 
present mean-modulated flicker because, when response time depends on both source and 
destination luminance, time-averaged luminance depends on flicker frequency and contrast. 
 
Here we present a battery of tests used to judge the suitability of displays for presenting 
mean-modulated flicker. We used these tests to reveal differences between a new 
high-performance LCD (EIZO ColorEdge CG247X) and a consumer-grade LCD (Dell U2415b); 
these differences were marked, despite the displays’ vendor-supplied specifications being 
almost identical (and useless in judging suitability for presenting mean-modulated flicker). The 
CG247X’s response times depended on both source and destination luminance, and, overall, 
were slow by comparison to the consumer-grade LCD. However, despite this nonlinear and 
sluggish behaviour, our tests revealed a contrast and frequency range wherein the CG247X’s 
display of mean-modulated flicker was without artifacts, that is, the relationship between 
nominal and displayed luminance was linear.

Methods 
 
Displays and Visual stimuli. ​We measured luminance on two LCDs: EIZO ColorEdge CG247X, 
and Dell U2415b. The former is a high-performance display; the latter is a consumer-grade 
display. Both displays were purchased in 2018, have received limited use, and have almost 
identical vendor-issued specifications: panel type (in-plane switching), size (61.1 cm), native 
resolution (1920-by-1200 pixels at 60 Hz), pixel pitch (0.270-by-0.270 mm), viewing angle (178 
deg horizontal and vertical), and response time (gray-to-gray between 8 and 10 ms). We used 
the displays’ factory default settings with one exception: the “brightness” of the U2415b was 
reduced to 35% to make the maximum displayed luminance of the two devices approximately 
equal (120 cd/m​2​). For both displays, we used spatial resolution of 1920-by-1200 pixels and 
temporal resolution of 60 Hz. Luminance was rendered on displays using Psychtoolbox [30, 31, 
32] (version 3.0.16) and MATLAB (version 9.5.0.944444, R2018b); Mathworks, ​Natick, 
Massachusetts​, USA). We used a standard desktop computer running Linux (Ubuntu version 
18.04) installed with an NVIDIA graphics card (QUADRO P620; ​Santa Clara, California ​,​ United 
States​). 
 
Display linearization. ​Displays were linearized in the standard fashion. We presented static test 
patches (384-by-384 pixels) at position 5 (Figure 1, inset) on a black background (luminance = 
0%). Using a spot meter (LS-110; Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) we measured displayed 
luminance at 11 nominal luminances (spanning the range from black to white): 0, 10, 20 … 
100%. We then fit a model of displayed luminance: 
 
f(x) = ax​b​,

where x is the nominal luminance, and a and b are free parameters. We verified the fitted 
model, presenting luminances f​-1​(0), f​-1​(10), f​-1​(20) … f​-1​(100%) and ensuring the displayed 
luminances formed a zero-intercept straight line. 
 
Photodiode device and Electrical recordings.​ We built a device comprising a PN photodiode 
(BPW21R; Vishay Intertechnology, ​Malvern, Pennsylvania ​, ​United States​) designed for 
applications requiring high-precision and linearity, and a custom electronic circuit. We verified 
the linearity of our device by measuring the luminance of 11 static test patches (luminances = 0, 
10, 20 … 100%; see ​Display linearization ​) with both the photodiode device and the LS-110 spot 
meter. Photodiode device output was visualized online using a digital oscilloscope (InfiniiVision 
DSO-X 2002A, firmware version: 02.50.2019022736; Keysight Technologies, Colorado Springs, 
CO, USA). We also used the scope to acquire electrical recordings, and to derive response 
times, cycle-averaged luminance, and r.m.s. luminance. 
 
Spatial and temporal uniformity.​ To quantify the spatial and temporal uniformity of the displays, 
we presented static test patches (384-by-384 pixels) at nine positions (Figure 1, inset). At each 
position, we presented low-, medium-, and high-luminance patches (luminance = 0, 50, and 
100%, respectively), measuring luminance with the LS-110 spot meter which we held by hand 
fronto-parallel to the patch. Furthermore, at position 5, we presented static test patches at 11 
different luminances (0, 10, 20 … 100%), measuring 10 one-second recordings of luminance 
with our photodiode device. The photodiode was positioned 1 cm from the display, 
fronto-parallel, using a laser-cut acrylic arm mounted on the display housing. We computed the

Fourier transforms of these photodiode device recordings using MATLAB (version 9.3.0.713579, 
R2017b). 
 
Response times. ​We measured response times, that is, the time taken to transition between 
luminances L1 and L2. L1 and L2 took values 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100%. Stimuli were square 
patches (384-by-384 pixels) at position 5 (Figure 1, inset). Stimuli were sequenced as follows: 
black (luminance = 0%) preceded stimulus L1; L1 was presented for 10 frames (166.67 ms); L2 
was presented for 10 frames immediately following L1; black followed L2. We used the standard 
definition of rise (fall) time between luminance L1 and L2 as the duration of the transition from 
10 to 90% (90 to 10%). For example, the rise time between luminance 10% and 50% was 
defined as the time taken to transition from 14% to 46%. 
 
Mean-modulated flicker.​ We presented mean-modulated flicker at position 5 (Figure 1, inset). 
The time-averaged mean luminance of flicker was 50%. We computed contrast (the temporal 
analogue of Michelson contrast) using the equation: 
 
C = 100(L ​max​ - L ​min​)/(L ​max​ + L ​min​),  
 
where L ​max​ is maximum luminance and L ​min​ is minimum luminance. We used five flicker 
contrasts ranging from 20 to 100%, and flicker frequencies ranging from 0.94 Hz (flicker period 
= 64 frames) to 30 Hz (flicker period = 2 frames).  
 
Paired biphasic luminance pulses.​ We presented single, biphasic luminance pulses 
(positive/negative) at position 5 (Figure 1, inset). The mean luminance of these pulses was 
p. 9 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
50%, and their peak-to-peak amplitude was 50%. The duration of each phase was 1 frame 
period (16.67 ms); the duration of each pulse was 2 frames. The first of these pulses was 
delayed by a fixed period relative to a stable trigger, T​t​. The second through fifth of these pulses 
were identical to the first pulse, but delayed by 1 through 4 frames relative to the first pulse, 
respectively. We also presented paired, biphasic pulses. The first pulse of all pairs was delayed 
by T​t​. We parametrically varied the offset between pulses comprising the pair, T = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 
4 times the frame period. We used single-pulse responses to predict each paired-pulse 
response. To model the display’s nonlinearities, we subtracted the displayed luminance 
response to a paired-pulse stimulus from the prediction. 
 
Model of displayed luminance.​ We modeled the function transferring nominal luminance to 
displayed luminance as a causal, exponential decay, i.e., 
 
x(t) = s(t) * k(t), 
 
where x() denotes the display luminance, s() denotes the nominal luminance, a square wave 
with 50% duty-cycle, k() denotes the display transfer function, and the asterisk denotes 
convolution. We modelled the display transfer function, k(), as 
 
k(t) = exp(-t/tau) for t >= 0, and k(t) = 0 for t < 0. 
 
Using the model response, x(), we derived the cycle-averaged luminance and 
root-mean-squared luminance for different amplitudes and frequencies of s(). We optimized the 
free parameter, tau, to minimize the sum of the squared error between the model-derived

measures and those derived from photodiode recordings (see ​Photodiode device and Electrical 
recordings​).

Results 
 
Spatial uniformity of displayed luminance can vary widely between different makes and models 
of LCD, the major determinant of uniformity being the backlight scheme [33]. Two commonplace 
schemes are, first, direct backlighting, wherein a spatial array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
and a diffuser screen sit behind the liquid crystal panel, and, second, edge illumination, wherein 
light emitted by a linear array of diodes at one of the display’s edges is spatially distributed via 
lightguide. We quantified the spatial uniformity of the CG247X by presenting low-, medium-, and 
high-luminance static test patches at nine display positions (Figure 1, inset) and using the 
LS-110 spot meter to measure the luminance of each patch. At each luminance tested, we 
calculated the grand average over all display positions, and divisively normalized 
measurements by that average. As illustrated in Figure 1, at medium- and high-luminance, the 
CG247X showed greater spatial uniformity than our consumer-grade LCD (Dell U2415b): for the 
CG247X, spatial variation was 5.1% at medium and 3.5% at high luminance, whereas for the 
U2415b, variation was 8.1% at medium and 8.5% at high luminance. The uniformity of the two 
displays was comparable at low luminance (CG247X, 27% versus U2415b, 17%).

and high-luminance (0, 50, 100% luminance, respectively) static test patches at nine 
display positions (inset), measuring luminance with the LS-110 spot meter. At each 
luminance tested, we calculated the grand average, and divisively normalized 
measurements by that average. Each symbol shows the geometric average of six 
normalized measurements, and error bars, where not obscured by plot symbols, show

U2415b (​B​). Uniformity was comparable at low luminance (black symbols). The dashed 
square indicates the size of a test patch. 
 
A common misconception among vision researchers and clinicians is that LCDs do not flicker 
(i.e., that LCDs are temporally uniform). In fact, there are two major sources of flicker that can 
affect a LCD: first, backlight flicker (e.g., citations [24, 34]) (e.g., Elze & Tanner [24], and 
Ghodrati, Morris, & Price [34]), and, second, the so-called frame response [35, 23]. Frame 
responses are largely attributable to an LCD’s inversion scheme: a feature of modern displays 
wherein the polarity of the video signal voltage applied to the liquid crystal material is inverted 
from one video frame to the next. This inversion minimises long-term degradation, or aging, of 
the display by minimizing the DC voltage across the liquid crystal elements. Frame inversion 
schemes typically have fine spatial structure, on the scale of individual pixels, making them 
mostly imperceptible (e.g., dot inversion schemes [35]). We quantified the temporal uniformity of 
the CG247X by presenting (nominally) static test patches at display position 5 (Figure 1, inset) 
and using our linearized photodiode device to measure displayed luminance over time. At each 
of 11 luminances (0, 10, 20 … 100%) we made 10 one-second recordings, averaging the 
Fourier amplitude spectra of those 10 recordings. Figure 2 shows the average spectrum at each 
luminance. The spectra of the CG247X revealed a frame response comprising a 60 Hz 
component as well as harmonic components at integer multiples of 60 Hz. The response at 60 
Hz varied non-monotonically in amplitude with the luminance of the static test patch, peaking at 
a luminance of 50%. However, the CG247X appeared free of backlight modulations. This 
absence of modulations free us of the consequences of said modulations (often desynchronized 
with the frame refresh signal) on increment/decrement transitions btw luminances (see Fig. 5 in 
p. 13 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
[24]). The spectra of our consumer-grade LCD also revealed a frame response, as well as 1.2 
kHz flicker, likely associated with the back light. This latter temporal nonuniformity increased 
linearly with the luminance of the static test patch. For each display, we verified that the frame 
response was optical and not related to any radiated electromagnetic noise: We used the 
oscilloscope to visualize the Fourier amplitude spectrum online. We then interposed opaque 
cardboard between the photodiode and display which caused the disappearance of the frame 
response. For the U2415b, we similarly verified that the 1.2 kHz response was optical. 
 
Figure 2 caption​: Temporal uniformity of nominally static test patches. We presented 
nominally static test patches at display position 5 (Figure 1, inset), measuring luminance 
with a linearized photodiode device. At each luminance (0, 10, 20 … 100%) we made 
ten 1-second recordings, deriving the Fourier amplitude spectrum for each. Each 
spectrum illustrated is the average of 10 spectra. For each display, we normalized 
spectra such that 1000 corresponds to the DC component at 50% luminance; therefore, 
a value of 5.0 corresponds to approximately 0.15 cd/m​2​. The spectra of the CG247X 
(upper) revealed a frame response, comprising a 60 Hz component and harmonic 
components at integer multiples of 60 Hz. This frame response varied non-monotonically 
in amplitude with the luminance of the static test patch, peaking between 40 and 50% 
luminance. The spectra of the U2415b (lower) also revealed a frame response, as well 
as 1.2 kHz flicker which increased linearly with the luminance of the static test patch 
(amplitudes above 5.0 are not shown, arrow heads). For the U2415b, mains noise (50 
Hz) was apparent at high-luminance. lum., luminance.

DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
In general, LCD response times -- the duration of the rise or fall of a step from one luminance 
level to another -- vary as a function of both step source and destination. This nonlinear 
behaviour is owing largely to mechanisms of response time compensation (RTC) (e.g., the work 
of McCartney [25]), a feature of many modern LCDs designed to enhance video. RTC 
mechanisms speed luminance transitions by transiently altering the voltage applied to the liquid 
crystal associated with individual pixels (e.g., Figure 1 in [27]; Figure 5 in [24]). We measured 
the CG247X’s response times by presenting luminance steps -- both increments and 
decrements -- to our linearized photodiode device. Step source and destination took values 0, 
25, 50, 75, or 100%. As illustrated in Figure 3, response times varied as a function of both 
luminance step source and destination. For example, stepping from 0% luminance to 25% 
luminance took 24.5 ms, stepping from 75% to 100% took 12.9 ms, and stepping from 25% to 
0% took 8.1 ms. All of these steps are the same height, but response times differ markedly. 
Overall, the response times of our consumer-grade LCD were less than the CG247X response 
times. However, as we will illustrate below, faster is not better; although RTC mechanisms 
reduced the response times of our consumer-grade LCD, it contaminated displayed luminance 
with overshoot and undershoot artifacts in such a way as to render the display unsuitable for 
use in most clinical and experimental vision research. For similar reasons, most 
consumer-grade LCDs are unsuitable for vision research. RTC mechanisms lower 
“black-white-black” and “grey-to-grey” response times, which are used to promote displays to 
the gaming community and other consumer markets.

These rise times (upward triangles) decreased with increasing destination luminance. 
The gray box labelled “25%” shows mean response times of transitions from source 
luminance = 25% to destination luminances = 0, 50, 75, and 100%. The fall time 
(downward triangle), from 25% to 0% luminance, was less than the rise times. Overall, 
response times varied as a function of both source and destination luminance, as is 
generally expected of LCDs. We made 10 measurements at each source/destination 
luminance pair; error bars, where not obscured by symbols, mark the full range (from 
minimum to maximum) of these 10 measurements. (​B​) U2415b response times. 
Graphical conventions are as in A. Overall, U2415b response times were less than 
CG247X response times. 
 
At the outset of this study, we made preliminary measurements similar to those illustrated in 
Figure 3. These preliminary measurements led us to wonder whether the CG247X was suitable 
for displaying mean-modulated flicker; rise and fall times that straddled luminance of 50%. For 
example, the rise time from 25% to 75% (16.3 ms) and the fall time from 75% to 25% (17.1 ms) 
were approximately equal. To better determine the CG247X’s suitability for presenting 
mean-modulated flicker, and its susceptibility, or otherwise, to overshoot and undershoot 
artifacts typical of LCDs implementing RTC mechanisms, we presented mean-modulated flicker 
on both the CG247X and our consumer-grade display, using our linearized photodiode device to 
measure luminance over time. We used a flicker period of 20 frames (333.3 ms), and contrast 
ranging from 20 to 100%. As illustrated in Figure 4, the consumer-grade display’s luminance 
traces revealed overshoot and undershoot artifacts symptomatic of RTC. The CG247X’s 
luminance traces, however, appeared free of RTC artifacts. We used these traces to estimate 
response times specific to mean-modulated flicker, illustrated in Figure 5. Overall, CG247X rise 
p. 16 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
and fall times were greater than those of our consumer-grade LCD. However, with the exception 
of 100% contrast, CG247X rise and fall times were approximately equal, indicating its likely 
suitability for presenting mean-modulated flicker.

100% in increments of 20 as marked. At 40% contrast, the arrows show examples of 
luminance step source and destination as used in the computation of response times 
(Fig. 5). For each display, we normalized traces to the luminance step destination at 
100% contrast. For the U2415b, over- and undershoot are readily apparent at low and 
moderate contrast. The CG247X, however, shows exponential rise and fall, regardless of 
contrast.

(upward triangles) and fall (downward triangles) times were greater than U2415b (​B​) rise 
and fall times. With the exception of 100% contrast, CG247X rise and fall times were 
approximately equal, indicating its potential suitability for presenting mean-modulated 
flicker. Each symbol represents the mean of 10 measurements. Error bars, where not 
obscured by symbols, mark the full range (minimum to maximum) of the 10 
measurements. 
 
To further assess the CG247X’s suitability for presenting mean-modulated flicker, we presented 
flicker at frequencies ranging from 0.94 to 30 Hz and contrasts ranging from 20 to 100%. We 
used recorded traces (similar to those in Figure 4) to derive cycle-averaged luminance. In Figure 
p. 17 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
6, we illustrate how cycle-averaged luminance was approximately constant for all flicker 
frequencies, and for contrasts up to 80%. At 100% contrast, cycle-averaged luminance 
decreased with flicker frequency, indicating that, at full contrast, the monitor is not suitable for 
presenting mean-modulated flicker. Cycle-averaged luminance recorded from our 
consumer-grade LCD (Dell U2415b) varied as a function of flicker frequency at all contrasts 
tested, indicating the display’s lack of suitability for the presentation of mean-modulated flicker. 
We also used CG247X traces to derive cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance. In Figure 6, we 
illustrate how cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance decreased with flicker frequency, indicative of 
loss of contrast. The consumer-grade LCD was affected by both changes in cycle-averaged 
luminance and loss of contrast. 
 
Figure 6 caption​: Cycle-averaged luminance and root-mean-squared luminance of 
mean-modulated flicker. We presented mean-modulated flicker at a range of flicker 
frequencies (0.94 to 30 Hz) and contrasts (20 to 100%). We used waveforms (e.g., 
Figure 4) recorded from the CG247X (​A​) to derive cycle-averaged luminance; we 
divisively normalized that derived measure using the cycle-averaged luminance of a 
“reference” waveform, that is, the response to contrast = 20% and flicker frequency = 
0.94 Hz. For clarity, cycle-averaged responses for contrast = 40, 60, 80, and 100% are 
offset by -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, and -0.4 log units, respectively (arrows). As shown, 
cycle-averaged luminance was approximately constant for contrast = 20 to 80% at all 
flicker frequencies tested (0.94 to 30 Hz). At contrast = 100%, cycle-averaged luminance 
decreased with flicker frequency. Cycle-averaged luminance recorded from the 
consumer-grade U2415b (​B​) increased with flicker frequency at all contrasts tested. 
Graphical conventions are as in A. We used waveforms recorded from the CG247X (​C​) 
p. 18 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
to derive cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance; we divisively normalized that derived 
measure using cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance of the reference waveform (20%, 0.94 
Hz). As shown, at all contrasts tested (20 to 100%), cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance 
decreased with flicker frequency, indicative of a loss of effective contrast. 
Cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance recorded from the U2415b (​D​) revealed both increases 
and decreases to effective contrast with flicker frequency. Each symbol is the average of 
10 measurements. (None of the data in panels C and D is offset.) We modeled 
cycle-average luminance and r.m.s. luminance on the CG247X as a causal exponential 
decay (Methods). This model comprised one free parameter, tau. For the illustrated fit 
(blue), tau = 6.6 ms. 
 
Taken together, Figure 6, and the traces used to derive the measures plotted there, indicated a 
simple relationship between nominal and displayed luminance, namely, that the latter was, 
simply, a low-pass-filtered version of the former. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the 
function transferring nominal luminance to displayed luminance as a causal, exponential decay 
(Methods). We optimized the single free parameter in this model, the time constant of the 
exponential decay (tau), by minimizing the sum of the squared error between the model-derived 
cycle-averaged mean luminance and cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance, and those derived from 
the photodiode traces. The fit is illustrated in Figure 6 (blue). There, the fitted parameter, tau, 
was 6.6 ms. 
 
To quantify the nonlinearities associated with high-contrast, mean-modulated flicker, and to 
quantify temporal dependence between frames, we used a paired-pulse paradigm [36, 37]. We 
presented paired biphasic luminance pulses at position 5 (Figure 1, inset), systematically 
p. 19 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
varying the inter-pulse interval, T (Methods). We used the measured responses to individual 
pulses to predict paired-pulse responses, and to model the display’s nonlinearities we 
subtracted each paired-pulse response from its prediction. Figure 7 shows the nonlinear 
behaviour of the CG247X and, for comparison, that of our consumer-grade LCD. In our 
CG247X, a nonlinear mechanism appeared to speed the transition between white and black 
(100% and 0% luminance, respectively; leftmost upper panel in Figure 7B). When paired pulses 
were separated by 16.67 ms or more (the three rightmost upper panels in Figure 7B where 
predicted and displayed luminance are approximately equal), the CG247X behaved linearly, that 
is, we saw no evidence of temporal dependence between frames. In our consumer-grade LCD, 
a nonlinear mechanism appeared to attenuate the transition to white (100% luminance; leftmost 
lower panel in Figure 7B). This attenuation reconciles with Figure 4B, which shows marked 
overshoot at moderate contrast (e.g., 60% contrast, middlemost panel of Figure 4B), but a near 
absence of overshoot at high-contrast (rightmost panel of Figure 4B). Compared to the 
CG247X, the U2415b’s nonlinearities were large in magnitude and long-lasting. Paired pulses 
separated by as much as 33.33 ms (the third lower panel in Figure 7B, where predicted and 
displayed luminance are unequal) evoked nonlinear behaviour in the U2415b, that is, we saw 
clear evidence of temporal dependence between frames.  
 
Figure 7 caption​: Paired luminance pulses revealed nonlinearities in displayed 
luminance. (​A​) Illustration of the paired-pulse paradigm. We presented a single biphasic 
luminance pulse (e.g., left panel), parametrically varying its latency relative to a trigger 
(cf. left and middle panels). We then presented a pair of biphasic luminance pulses (right

and 3 times the frame period (frame period = 16.67 ms). Single-pulse responses can be

used to predict the paired-pulse response; differences between this prediction and the 
displayed luminance model the display’s nonlinearities. (​B​) Nonlinear behaviour of the 
CG247X (upper). The four panels show responses to paired pulses with various offsets, 
T; we normalized responses (0, 0.5 and 1 corresponded to 0, 50 and 100% luminance, 
respectively) and then subtracted the baseline. For each offset, the predicted displayed 
luminance derived from single-pulse responses is shown in blue, and the measured 
displayed luminance in response to paired pulses is shown in black. The measured 
responses are an average of 16 recordings. The difference, that is, the nonlinearity, is 
shown in red. For the CG247X, superposition (T = 0 ms) of pulses evoked a nonlinearity 
which accelerated the transition from 100% luminance to 0% luminance. There was 
negligible nonlinearity of displayed lumiance for T >= 16.67 ms. Compared to the 
CG247X’s nonlinearity, the U2415b’s nonlinearity (lower panels) was large in magnitude 
and long-lasting, affecting subsequent frames (to T = 33.33 ms). Graphical conventions 
are as in B.

Discussion 
 
This study is primarily concerned with the behaviour of displays used to present 
mean-modulated flicker in clinical or experimental settings. We recorded luminance waveforms 
from two LCDs, and derived several measures, including spatial uniformity, response times, 
Fourier amplitude spectra, cycle-averaged luminance, and root-mean-squared luminance. We 
presented paired luminance pulses to quantify the displays’ nonlinear dynamics at high-contrast 
and high frequency. We find the EIZO ColorEdge CG247X is suitable for displaying 
mean-modulated flicker within a range of contrasts (<= 80%) and frequencies (<= 30 Hz). Unlike 
CRT displays, relatively little has been written in the clinical and experimental vision literature 
about LCDs. Here, we review detailed studies of LCD behaviour, discussing their findings with 
respect to ours. 
 
Wang & Nikolić [28] tested a Samsung 2233RZ LCD, comparing its performance to a 
consumer-grade LCD, as well as a CRT display. They estimated spatial uniformity using 
measurement procedures similar to ours, reporting spatial variability of approximately 15% at 
high-luminance. Spatial variability of their CRT display (again, at high-luminance) was greater 
than 20%. Our CG247X, which varied by only 3.5% at high-luminance (Fig. 1), was more 
spatially uniform than all of their displays. Ghodrati, Morris, & Price [34] characterized the spatial 
uniformity of several LCDs, including two displays marketed specifically to vision researchers 
and clinicians (ViewPixx by VPixx Technologies Inc., Canada; and, Display++ by Cambridge 
Research Systems, UK). They too used procedures like ours, but quantified uniformity by 
deriving Michelson contrast, C​M​ = (L ​max​ - L ​min​)/(L ​max​ + L ​min​), where L ​max​ is maximum measured 
luminance (regardless of position 1 through 9) and L ​min​ is minimum measured luminance (again, 
p. 22 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
regardless of position). For comparison, we derived Michelson contrast for our CG247X at low-, 
medium-, and high-luminance: 0.16, 0.05, and 0.03, respectively. For our consumer-grade 
U2415b, Michelson contrast was 0.12, 0.07, and 0.08, respectively. That is, our displays 
outperformed all those tested by Ghodrati, Morris, & Price (including their CRT display, for which 
Michelson contrast ranged from 0.096 at high-luminance to 0.76 at low-luminance), with the 
exception of their ViewPix, which showed very low Michelson contrast (0.023) at 
high-luminance. These results, taken together with LCDs’ ability to render fine horizontal, 
oblique, and vertical gratings with little contrast attenuation [28, 29], confirm that overall the 
spatial uniformity of LCDs is usually superior to that of CRT displays. 
 
Using high-luminance pulses, Wang & Nikolić [28] measured the reliability of their displays, 
reporting errors of less than 0.04%. Although their results are difficult to interpret because 
“error” was not clearly defined, they are likely to be comparable to ours: For flicker contrast at 
100%, and flicker frequency at 0.94 Hz, we used 10 measurements of cycle-averaged 
mean-luminance, and 10 measurements of cycle-averaged r.m.s. luminance (Fig. 6), to 
compute coefficients of variation (for comparison, we express those coefficients as 
percentages). For our CG247X, we found coefficients of variation of 0.03% and 0.01% for 
mean-luminance and r.m.s. luminance, respectively. For our U2415b, we found coefficients of 
0.01% and 0.01%, respectively. At high-contrast (100%) and high-flicker-frequency (30 Hz), for 
our CG247X, we found coefficients of 0.64% and 0.48% for mean-luminance and r.m.s. 
luminance, respectively, and for our U2415b, we found coefficients of 0.33% and 0.24%, 
respectively. At moderate and low frequencies (< 30 Hz), and for all contrasts we tested (20 to 
100%), we found little difference between our two displays in terms of coefficient of variation of 
mean-luminance or r.m.s. luminance. Wang & Nikolić also reported temporal dependencies for 
p. 23 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
both their 2233RZ and their CRT display, that is, displayed luminance at frame ​n​ depended “to a 
degree on the luminance of the preceding frame [frame ​n-1 ​]” (see their Fig. 4). We used our 
response time data (Fig. 3) to test our displays’ temporal dependence, finding none for either 
our CG247X nor our consumer-grade LCD. In other words, at 3 Hz (stimulus period = 20 
frames, 333.3 ms), when analyzing luminance steps, step source had no apparent effect on 
step destination. However, as we discuss below, our use of paired pulses revealed 
high-contrast, high-flicker-frequency temporal dependence between frames on our 
consumer-grade LCD. 
 
Wang & Nikolić [28] measured response times (black-to-white and white-to-black, i.e., 100% 
contrast) of their displays by fitting exponential functions to rise and fall step responses 
separately. For their 2233RZ, they found fall time to be greater than rise time by a factor of 1.15. 
The most straightforward comparison between their results and ours is as follows: at 100% 
contrast, our CG247X’s rise time was greater than its fall time by a factor of 1.72 (Fig. 4); 
therefore, the CG247X is not suitable for presenting mean-modulated flicker at 100% contrast. 
Matsumoto and colleagues [38] noted that approximately equal rise and fall times are key LCD 
behaviour for presenting flickering stimuli. At 80% contrast, we found a much smaller 
discrepancy between fall time and rise time: the former was greater than the latter by a factor of 
only 1.05. For the consumer-grade LCD tested by Wang & Nikolić, fall time was greater than 
rise time by a factor of 2.35. Both our CG247X and our consumer-grade LCD outperformed their 
consumer-grade LCD. 
 
Our response time means (Fig. 3) were, overall, similar to those reported by other detailed 
characterizations of LCD behaviour [39, 24]. Our CG247X and our consumer-grade LCD mean 
p. 24 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
rise (fall) times were 13.64 (17.10) ms and 8.21 (7.8) ms, respectively. The latter compares 
favourably to the times reported by Elze & Tanner [24]. Like Elze & Tanner, we found 
discrepancies between our measurements and vendor-issued responses times (CG247X: 
gray-to-gray = 10 ms, and black-to-white = no data; U2415b: gray-to-gray = 8 ms, and 
black-to-white = 19 ms). On several LCDs, Watson [39] quantified motion blur, that is, 
“streaking” introduced to frames when a sluggish display represents a moving object. Motion 
blur is a luminance artifact largely determined by response time. Watson’s main measure of 
motion blur, Gaussian edge times (GETs), varied between approximately 7 and 22 ms across 
displays (see his Fig. 7). For comparison, we derived GETs for the waveforms we illustrated 
above in our Fig. 4. To do so, we used the “temporal step” method described by Watson, 
convolving those waveforms with a rectangular pulse (duration = 16.67 ms), fitting a cumulative 
Gaussian (Equations 1 & 2 in [39]), and recording the temporal interval between 10% and 90% 
points on that curve. We averaged GETs over all contrasts represented in Fig. 4 (20 to 100%), 
finding mean (s.d.) values comparable to Watson’s: CG247X = 20.5 (0.2) ms and U2415b = 
12.4 (1.8) ms. GET is a poorly performing metric where temporal responses show over- and 
undershoot [39]; this poor performance is reflected in the relatively large s.d. for our 
consumer-grade LCD (s.d. = 1.8 ms), which showed clear evidence of over- and undershoot 
(Fig. 4). 
 
We used paired luminance pulses to examine the temporal dynamics of artifacts relating to 
high-contrast, high-frequency flicker. Ghodrati, Morris, & Price [34] also examined artifact 
dynamics, plotting photodiode traces for one- and two-frame-duration black-white-black pulses 
(see their Fig. 6). Their photodiode device was not linearized, which complicates the 
interpretation of their results. Nonetheless, they succeeded in demonstrating some disturbing 
p. 25 
DISPLAY OF MEAN-MODULATED FLICKER 
artifacts of displayed luminance, the first and foremost being luminance blips on their Display++ 
(an LCD specifically marketed to vision researchers and clinicians) which appeared immediately 
after white-to-black transitions. None of our recordings on either of our displays revealed these 
trailing blips. However, our paired luminance pulses revealed nonlinearities in both our displays 
(Figure 7). These nonlinear mechanisms speeded transitions between extremes of luminance 
(CG247X), or attenuated overshoot and imparted temporal dependence between frames 
(U2415b). 
 
Our spectral analysis (Fig. 2) of displayed luminance of (nominally) static test patches on both 
our CG247X and our consumer-grade display revealed a frame response [24, 23, 35], that is, 
luminance modulation associated with display refresh rate (here, 60 frames per second). For 
both displays, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the fundamental component (60 Hz) of this 
response was small -- on the order of 0.1 cd/m​2​. However, this amplitude reflects our 
photodiode’s spatial aperture, which was large relative to the size of single pixels; because 
frame inversion schemes typically have fine spatial structure on the scale of individual pixels 
[35], the frame response of single pixels on either of our displays was likely much larger than 
our measurement. Our spectral analysis confirms and extends measurements by Elze & Tanner 
[24], who plotted the frame response fundamental amplitude for several displays, illustrating 
diversity between panels from different vendors ranging from near zero (EIZO S2431W) to 
approximately 2% (BenQ 241W). We extend the results of Elze & Tanner, quantifying the frame 
response’s non-monotonic dependence on luminance, peaking at mid-range luminances (Fig. 
2). It is noteworthy that neither of our displays exhibited “luminance stepping”, that is, saturation 
prior to meeting the destination luminance, which was apparent on the BenQ 241W display of 
Elze & Tanner, and, there, discussed in detail.

The above-described studies of LCD behaviour, taken together with our test results, capture a 
trend: for the intents and purposes of vision research, LCD performance continues to improve. 
Our tests revealed marked differences between two displays, despite these displays’ 
vendor-supplied specifications being almost identical. In other words, these specifications were 
entirely useless in judging suitability for presenting mean-modulated flicker. One of the displays 
tested -- the EIZO ColorEdge CG247X -- appears suitable for displaying mean-modulated flicker 
within a range of contrasts and frequencies. We hope the present battery of tests proves useful 
to others developing rigorous approaches to clinical assessment of vision and experimental 
studies of visual systems; we intend to use it when introducing new displays to our experimental 
set-ups.

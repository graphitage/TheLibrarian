ABSTRACT 
Obesity is associated with higher fatality risk and altered distribution of occupant injuries in automotive collisions 
partially because of the increased depth of abdominal soft tissue, which results in limited and/or delayed engagement 
of the lap belt with the pelvis and increases the risk of pelvis “submarining” under the lap belt exposing occupant’s 
abdomen to belt loading. Previous modeling studies have shown that pelvis submarining could not be replicated 
using existing human body models. The goal of this study is to perform model modifications and investigate 
whether they could lead to model submarining. By detaching the connections between the pelvis and surrounding 
flesh, submarining like belt kinematics were observed. By remeshing the flesh parts of the model, similar belt 
kinematics was observed but the pelvic wings were fractured. Finally, large shear deformation on the flesh together 
with submarining like kinematics were observed in the model with its flesh modelled using the meshless Smooth 
Particle Galerkin Method (SPG) method. The results of this study showed that SPG method has potential to simulate 
large deformations in soft tissue which may be necessary to improve the biofidelity of belt/pelvis interaction. 
INTRODUCTION 
Obesity is associated with increased fatality risk and altered distribution of occupant injuries relative to lower BMI 
occupants in automotive collisions [1-4]. This is partially because of the substantial effect that obesity has on 
occupant-restraint interaction. Restraining obese occupants is a challenge due to increased body mass, unfavorable 
belt placement [5], and increased forward excursion within the occupant compartment [6-7]. An increased depth of 
abdominal soft tissue, results in delayed and limited engagement of the lap belt with the pelvis and increases the risk 
of pelvis submarining under lap belt, exposing occupant’s abdomen to belt loading [7]. 
Several experimental studies have been performed to study the challenges obesity poses on restraint system during 
motor vehicle collisions (MVC). Forman et al. and Kent et al. [9-10] performed rear-seat sled tests on both obese 
male post mortem human surrogates (PMHSs) and 50th percentile PMHS. It was found that obese occupants 
exhibited backward torso rotation (pelvis forward of shoulders) at the time of maximum forward excursion, whereas 
non�obese occupants did not. Kent et al. [10] pointed out that obese PMHS in frontal-impact sled tests exhibited 
submarining behavior, which is defined as the properly-placed belt translated superiorly until it passed over the iliac 
crests and loaded the abdomen without engaging, or after disengaging, the pelvis [8]. The authors suggested that 
submarining resulted in increased forward excursion and decreased forward torso pitch, which may be related to 
increased risk of lower extremity and thoracic injuries in obese occupants. 
HBMs with varied stature, age and BMI levels were generated using University of Michigan Transportation 
Institute’s (UMTRI’s) rapid mesh morphing tools based on statistical models of external body contour and ribcage 
geometry. Obese version of both Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS) [11-12], and Global Human Body 
Models Consortium (GHBMC) [13] were generated. While these HBMs are available to study occupant 
submarining, simulations illustrating HBM responses similar to PMHS kinematics are not available in the literature. 
A series of obese THUMS simulation were performed in [14]. Greater forward excursion was observed in frontal 
impact simulation, but no submarining was observed. Similar efforts have been carried out by Gepner et al. [8] with 
Sun  2 
 
the obese GHBMC models. In the belt pull test simulations, the model did not exhibit submarining behavior as 
observed in the PMHS test [19]. Also, the lap belt pull simulations failed to reproduce the belt/abdomen interaction 
seen in the PMHS. It was also found that the material model used to represent the human body model flesh was 
found to be approximately one order of magnitude stiffer than human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. This 
study shows that improved modeling of the belt-flesh-pelvis interaction should be required to obtain biofidelic 
response.  
Experiments have suggested that adipose tissue is able to undergo substantially large shear deformations [15]. Such 
large deformations challenge lagrangian finite element approaches to modeling since such large deformations can 
result in instabilities and collapsing elements. Previous work has shown the potential to model these large 
deformations using meshfree methods, which offer advantages in simulating large deformation over conventional 
finite element methods [18]. The earliest developed meshfree method is the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) 
method [17]. However, this method suffers from tension instability, lack of consistency and other numerical artifacts 
if it is applied to solid analyses directly [16,17]. Recently, a robust and accurate meshfree method was developed by 
LSTC, referred to as Smoothed Particle Galerkin (SPG) method. The formulation is derived based on a smoothed 
displacement field within the meshfree Galerkin variational framework. It could provide stable and accurate solution 
for solid mechanics problems [17]. This method has been applied to manufacturing problems including drilling and 
metal milling. However, no previous study using this method for biological material can be found.  
Since improved modeling of belt-flesh-pelvis interaction in existing HBMs are needed, and previous works showed 
potential in new method for large deformation modelling, the goal of this study is to apply new approaches to model 
belt-flesh-pelvis interaction to the obese HBMs and evaluate their ability to replicate submarining in the belt pull test. 
METHODS 
The obese GHBMC models, developed by Hu et al. [13] were used as the baseline model for evaluation and 
modifications. Model responses were compared with the obese PMHS in a series of tabletop belt pull tests 
previously performed at the UVA-CAB [19]. Specifically, the PMHS with a BMI of 31 kg/m2, height of 1650 mm 
and weight of 84.4 kg was chosen for comparison with the GHBMC obese model with a height of 1750 mm and a 
BMI of 30 kg/m2. FE model of the test fixtures used in the belt pull tests previously developed using 3D drawings 
of the original test fixture were used in this study Gepner et al.  [8]. The baseline belt position, prescribed force time 
history was adapted from Gepner et al. [8], which was based on the experiment. Three independent methods for 
model modification were applied. First, the connection between the pelvis and surrounding tissue was removed, 
enabling relative motion between pelvis and flesh. Second, spatial discretization of the abdominal flesh was 
improved to obtain better resolution and sensitivity study on material stiffness were performed on the remeshed 
model. Third, SPG method was introduced to model the outer flesh to enable large deformation.  
Contact modification 
 
Figure 1 Schematic of detaching the surrounding soft tissue from the pelvis 
In the obese GHBMC models, the pelvic wings are connected to surrounding tissue through tied contact and shared 
nodes (Figure 2). This could potentially prevent the large shear motion within the elements of surrounding soft 
tissue since some element always have to be connected to the bony pelvis. Since we theorized that the key to 
Sun  3 
 
submarining is the large shear motion on the flesh, we released the constraints between the pelvis and the 
surrounding flesh and explore whether this would enable large shear motion. The schematic of this detachment can 
be seen in Figure 1. Specifically, we released the tied contacts and shared nodes relation between the parts and ran 
the belt pull test simulation with three different input pulses. The first pulse is the baseline pulse fitted from the 
PMHS test. The second pulse was obtained by increasing the peak force to compensate for difference in 
anthropometry between the HBM and PMHS. Finally, by increasing the holding time of the peak force, the overall 
energy input was increased to obtain the third pulse.

Model Remeshing 
The obese GHBMC models were generated with rapid mesh morphing tools based on statistical models of external 
body contour and ribcage geometry. During this process, only nodal coordinates changed. Contact definition, 
material properties and element definition remained unchanged. To account for differences in external body contour 
of an obese occupant, abdominal and thoracic flesh layer were thickened by stretching the elements in the morphing 
process. As shown in Figure 8, the obese GHBMC only used three elements across the abdominal front wall. Since 
these elements were directly stretched from elements in the 50th percentile GHBMC model, they all have suboptimal 
aspect ratios. To improve mesh quality, remeshing was performed on two solid and two shell parts. Both solid parts 
were meshed with constant density tetrahedral elements. The number of elements increased by around 50,000 after 
the remeshing. A baseline simulation was first performed, followed by a three times baseline simulation. Then, 
pelvic wing yielding criteria was turned off and a three times baseline simulation was performed. Finally, material 
property was adjusted, and a baseline simulation was performed.

SPG implementation 
Although SPG is a meshless method by nature, the creation of SPG particle is mesh based. After creating the mesh, 
LS-DYNA solver turns each node in the selected SPG section into one smooth particle and discard the solid element 
connection between the particles. Since the method of SPG performs well with at least 3 layers of smoothed 
particles in between the lagrangian boundaries and particle needs to be distributed as evenly as possible, the 
remeshed model nodal coordinates were used to turn the outer thoracic and abdominal flesh nodes into smoothed 
particles while the skin and inner flesh remained in lagrangian formulation. More than 10 layers of SPG particles 
were generated at every nodal position in between the lagrangian boundaries of the remeshed model but the nodal 
connectivity within the flesh parts were neglected in the computation. In this study, two simulations were performed 
with three times of baseline input. One of them has pelvic wing yielding criteria turned off while the other has it 
remained on. Another simulation was performed with 1.5 times baseline input and with a less stiff flesh material 
model.

RESULTS 
For all belt pull simulations, graphs showing the comparison of belt trajectories obtained from the experiment and 
the simulation, as well as time histories of belt pulling force and belt displacement are presented in the results 
session. For the belt trajectories, the time histories for points on the belt directly anterior to ASISL and ASISR were 
extracted and plotted in green dots over the experimental results in blue dots.  
Detached pelvis to flesh 
When the detached model was pulled with the baseline force that fitted to the time history from the experiment, no 
submarining was observed (Figure 5). The blue dots showed that in the experiment, the belt started moving towards 
Sun  5 
 
the ASIS and then changed direction to load the abdomen. The green dots showed that, in the simulation, the belt 
went straight towards the pelvis without showing trend for direction change.  
 
Figure 5 Detached pelvis with a fit-to-experiment input pulse 
When the amount of energy input to the system was increased by both increasing the peak force and its holding time 
before release, highly matched belt trajectory with the experiment was observed (Figure 6). The belt first 
compressed the abdomen towards the pelvis, then under the influence of the reaction force from the pelvic wings, 
changed its direction and moved in to compress the abdominal cavity.

Remeshed abdomen and thorax 
Under baseline loading conditions, the model could not submarine due to lack of energy (Figure 7). When 
peak force was increased to three times of baseline, the model submarined (Figure 8). However, the pelvic 
wing elements reached their yielding point and started to fail. By turning off the failure criteria on the 
Sun  6 
 
pelvic wings, the same input condition led to a negative volume problem in the flesh and no submarining 
was observed (Figure 9).

SPG abdomen and thorax 
Similar to the remeshed lagrangian model, under baseline loading conditions, the SPG model did not submarine 
possibly due to lack of energy. With a three times baseline force input, the model submarined but the pelvic wing 
elements were failed when the pelvis failure criteria was on. When turning off the pelvic failure criteria, the belt 
managed to load the abdomen into large shear without running into negative volume problem as encountered in the 
lagrangian model. A comparison revealed that lap belt found a different path to load the abdomen, avoiding loading 
the pelvic wings to failure (Figure 10).

DISCUSSIONS 
Detached pelvis to flesh 
When pulling the detached pelvis model with the baseline force, the model did not submarine due to insufficient 
energy. First, the peak force was hold for less than 20ms, leaving not enough time for belt movement. Second, the 
obese GHBMC in the simulation is an overall larger person than the PMHS, therefore requiring more energy to 
achieve the same amount of deformation. Third, [8] we concluded that abdominal flesh in the Obese GHBMC 
appeared to be orders of magnitude stiffer in shear compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue. These three reasons 
would affect the pulling force required to reach desired deformation, therefore lead to the non-submarining results.  
When the input force was scaled to two times the baseline and held longer, the global belt kinematics matched with 
the belt pull test well. We concluded this type of simulation as the type I submarining. However, type I submarining 
is not what happens in human body since surrounding muscles are attached to the pelvic wings. Computationally, 
the original boundary condition of the belt pull test was broken actively by detaching surrounding tissue from the 
pelvis. As a result, this method should not be used to modify the current obese GHBMC models for further 
simulations. 
Remeshed abdomen and thorax 
The remeshed model submarined since pelvic wing being sheared off to failure broke the original boundary 
conditions. We define this as the type II submarining, also the pseudo submarining. Turning off the pelvic wing 
failure criteria would prevent pseudo submarining from happening. This can be achieved in two ways. The first 
method is to increase the yielding point to make it almost not reachable in the current simulation setting. The second 
method is to turn off the yielding criteria directly. Both methods gave the same response. After turning off the 
failure criteria on pelvic wings using either method, negative volume in flesh happened. This showed that by 
keeping the boundary condition intact, the remeshed model could not submarine. 
SPG abdomen and thorax 
To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first simulation study using SPG to model soft tissue in HBMs. This 
new modeling approach resulted in model submarining in the belt pull test simulation. Gepner et al. [8] theorized 
that, in the belt pull test, the belt is initially pulled towards the pelvis and then encounters the bony pelvis, which 
provides a reaction force to guide the belt over the iliac crest and into the abdomen. In this study, when the 
abdominal flesh is modelled with SPG, tissue compression first happened. Then, under the guidance of the reaction 
force from pelvic wings, the lap belt changed its direction and went over the iliac wings. By applying proper 
parameters for the SPG particles, it was found that belt displacement over the pelvic wings can be controlled. Also, 
by turning off the pelvic wing failure parameter, the belt managed to navigate a different path to submarining, which 
appears to be superior to the one with pelvic wing failure parameter. This difference in trajectory showed that 
turning off the pelvic wing failure criteria did change the overall kinematics of the belt. 
It is worth noting that this is not a model validation study since the HBM in this study has different anthropometry 
from the PMHS being compared. However, this study showed that three types of model modifications can make the 
model reach desired kinematics. Specifically, this study supported the theorized mechanism of submarining by 
Gepner et. al [8] by showing promising results in the SPG models. However, potential contact and stability issues 
still exists and need to be further evaluated.  
CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions can be drawn from this study:  
1. Submarining could happen due to breaking of boundary condition or large shear deformation in flesh.  
2. Detaching the connection between the pelvis and surrounding flesh could break the boundary condition and 
therefore lead to submarining.  
3. Pulling hard with a denser mesh in the flesh could break the boundary condition and therefore lead to 
submarining.

4. Large shear deformation can be realized through using SPG particle to particle bond failure criteria. 
5. Tuned SPG parameters worked well in the belt pull test simulation, recreating similar kinematics in the Obese 
GHBMC model to the PMHS

Abstract
The compartmentalization of chemical reactions within droplets has advantages in
low costs, reduced consumption of reagents and increased throughput. Reactions in
small droplets have also been shown to greatly accelerate the rate of many chemical
reactions. The accelerated growth rate of nanobubbles from nanodroplet reactions is
demonstrated in this work. The gaseous products from the reaction at the nanodroplet
surface promoted nucleation of hydrogen nanobubbles within multiple organic liquid
nanodroplets. The nanobubbles were confined within the droplets and selectively grew
and collapsed at the droplet perimeter, as visualized by microscopy with high spatial
and temporal resolutions. The growth rate of the bubbles was significantly accelerated
within small droplets and scaled inversely with droplet radius. The acceleration was
attributed to confinement from the droplet volume and effect from the surface area on
the interfacial chemical reaction for gas production. The results of this study provide
further understanding for applications in droplet enhanced production of nanobubbles
and the on-demand liberation of hydrogen.

Droplets readily facilitate the miniaturization and compartmentalization of reactions as ‘mini
reactors’. Their discrete nature lends itself to cost-effective, high throughput screening and
sensing applications.1–8 Many chemical reactions confined within droplets may also occur
much faster than in bulk, in some cases, by a factor of a million.9–15 Similar acceleration has
also been demonstrated for reactions taking place within a thin liquid film.16 The approach
draws parallels to ‘on-water’ chemistry, where the rate of reaction and product collection
are enhanced at the water interface, despite of poor reagent solubility.17 Now, so called
‘on-droplet’ chemistry is attracting increasing research attention to accelerate reactions even
further.18
The mechanisms of acceleration are still under investigation, however, are generally at-
tributed to the following factors. First, the concentration of reagents within droplets may
be progressively increased as the solvent component evaporates; as is the case in sprays dur-
ing mass-spectrometry. Second, the diffusion of reagents is enhanced within small droplets.
Moreover, the collision and mixing of droplets may enhance the rate by further reducing the
effective diffusion length scale.19–21 Both these influences are intuitively rationalized through
concepts such as collision theory.
Arguably the most intriguingly and complex factor is influence from the droplet interface.
Several studies have demonstrated that the interface itself may alter the reaction. Nakatani
and coworkers utilized optical trapping to demonstrate that dye formation and electron
transfer were accelerated at singular droplet interfaces. The enhancement was attributed to
the increasing surface area to volume ratio as the droplet size was reduced.22–24 Meanwhile,
Fallah-Araghi et al. demonstrated that reaction rate was inversely proportional to the droplet
2
radius owing to the favourable adsorption/desorption of products at the droplet interface,
shifting equilibrium forward.25 Li et al. further demonstrated that the transport of precursors
to the interface was proportional to the reaction rate and could be varied according the the
reagent substituents.11 Besides altering the reaction rate, microdroplet reactions sometimes
yield products different from their bulk counterparts or occur via distinct intermediates.26,27
This scale influence on the reaction is so pronounced that droplet mediated reactions are
a burgeoning area of interest within prebiotic chemistry as a component to the origins of
life.28,29 Nam et al. showed that the phosphorylation of sugars occurred spontaneously in
aqueous microdroplets. The entropic barrier observed in bulk solution was found to be
negligible within droplets, suggesting that reduced entropy change may be attributed to
the alignment of reactants at the interface.27 At low concentrations, various biomolecules
such as pyruvate and cysteine have been shown to spontaneously reduce at the droplet-air
interface.30 Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that gold nanowires could be prepared
within microdroplets despite the absence of reducing agents.31 Banerjee and Zare have also
highlighted that surface charge, namely, surface protons of the droplet, could replace the need
for acid catalysts.32 These discoveries demonstrate the replacement of a pivotal reagents by
the physical properties of the interface, alluding to an alternative approach for enhanced
chemical reactions.27,30,32,33
In studying reactions confined by liquid-air interfaces, microdroplets are most often pro-
duced as atomized sprays, such as in electrospray ionisation (ESI). The sprays yield a range
of droplet radii typically between 1 - 50 µm. The various adaptations of this method have
recently been reviewed.34 During flight, reactions take place as the droplets evaporate, be-
fore the product(s) are collected, typically by a mass spectrometer inlet. Multiple droplet
sources may also be combined to promote collisions.20 The distance, velocity of the spray can
be experimentally controlled or subjected to other experimental conditions such as light.35
In an effort to accurately control droplet size, piezoelectric dispensers were recently uti-
lized to study reactions within singular droplets.36 At the same time, recent reports indicate
3
challenges in disentangling the influence of compartmentalization from non-droplet related
processes in ESI experiments. Gallo et al.37 suggested the results observed in electrosprays
were not necessarily reflective of pristine droplet-air interfaces. Meanwhile Jacobs et al.38
demonstrated gas-phase reactions could also account for the products attributed to in-droplet
processes. These findings suggest the development of alternative experiment designs are nec-
essary in advancing the field. Alternative methods including larger sized Leidenfrost droplets
from simple pipette deposition has also been studied.9 Reactions confined within liquid-liquid
interfaces have also been investigated by multiple droplet sprays.13 In addition, several stud-
ies have utilized emulsions (radius ∼ 1 - 30 µm) to study reactions internal to the droplet25
and between the droplet and bulk phase.3,22–24
In terms of further elucidating the mechanisms of droplet accelerated reactions, surface
nanodroplets may provide many advantages. Surface nanodroplets are droplets with lateral
diameters between 0.1 – 10 µm, heights ranging 10 – 1000 nm, and typical volume of the
order femto- or attoliters; (10−15 L, 10−18 L, respectively.) Solvent exchange demonstrates
flexibility in terms of controlling droplet size, morphology and liquid properties.39,40 Solvent
exchange describes the heterogeneous nucleation and growth from mixing induced oversat-
uration. The droplet size can be tailored by solution and flow conditions while the droplet
morphology can be tailored by the relevant interfacial tensions.39,41,42 Different compositions
in the droplets can be formed by co-precipitation from the mixture of the solutions.43 Sur-
face nanodroplets are stabilized by pinning effect on the boundary. Their long-term stability
allows for following the reaction dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolutions.
Despite of significant influences on a wide range of chemical reactions, formation and
growth of nanobubbles from droplet reactions has been rarely explored. The formation of
bubbles confined within fluids is in and of itself relevant to a number of processes,44 such as
food and material manufacturing, and local heating in thermal therapy by plasmonic effect of
nanoparticle.45,46 In particular, the formation of bubbles within confined nano/micro-fluids
is a growing field which has largely only been discussed theoretically.47–52 Experimentally,
4
the cavitation of bubbles has been explored in droplets of the order ∼ 20-150 µm.53–55 It is
unclear how the droplet size influences the evolution of gas nanobubbles produced from a
droplet reaction.
Here, we exploit the unique properties of surface nanodroplets to expand the portfolio
of droplet mediated reactions. While existing studies have been isolated to liquid phase
reactions, we will demonstrate the liberation of gaseous products as surface nanobubbles
confined by surface nanodroplets. Gas-evolution reaction with polymeric and composite
surface nanodroplets liberates H2 gas and subsequently drives the formation of nanobubbles
(< 200 nm). By following the size of nanobubbles, the effect of the droplet size on the growth
rate of nanobubbles is unravelled. The findings from this study highlight the opportunities for
enhanced nanobubble formation and the on-demand liberation of hydrogen as clean energy
source by control and design of the size of reactive droplets.

Results and Discussion
Nanobubble formation from droplet reaction
Hydrogen nanobubbles were produced from the biphasic reaction between PMH nan-
odroplets and water, catalyzed by NaOH in the solution as shown in Figure 1. PMH is
attacked by hydroxide ions, driving the liberation of H2, the reformation of hydroxide and
the progressive formation of a copolymer, poly(methylhydro-co-methylhydroxy)siloxane.56
The reaction takes place at the surface of PMH droplets as water is insoluble in PMH
droplets.
The size of the droplets produced by solvent exchange was heterogeneous, enabling com-
parison of the effect of droplet size on bubble production rate in the same experiment. The
morphology of PMH droplets was revealed by liquid AFM, as shown in Figure 2. These
droplets exhibit and maintain spherical cap geometry from a range of droplet sizes with
lateral diameters ∼ 250 nm - 1 µm. For droplets with 0.7 µm < D < 1 µm the contact angle
was measured by height imaging in water to be ∼ 14-18◦, possibly influenced by slight defor-
mation from AFM imaging.57 Utilizing the PeakForce imaging at an extremely low set-point
force gave the contact angle of the droplets on the order ∼ 20 ± 2 ◦ in water, still smaller
than the macroscopic contact angles in Table 1. This result is consistent with the previ-
ous report that the contact angle of nanodroplets is generally smaller than the macroscopic
counterparts.39
The bubble formation was induced by addition of sodium hydroxide solution. Certain
incubation time was required before onset of nanobubble formation. Three representative
examples of the visualized reactions in varying droplet size are shown in Figure 3. A largest
PMH droplet with a diameter D of ∼ 15 µm is shown in Figure 3A. At t1 ∼ 320 s, a number
of small bubbles can be seen as bright circular regions at the perimeter of the droplet. The
bubbles were approximately ∼ 500 nm in diameter. Over time, an increased number of
bubbles formed and grew. Next series in Figure 3B shows the case of a smaller droplet with
∼ 6 µm in diameter. Here it is clear that the bubbles could grow (t1 – t2), coalesce (t2 –

t3) and collapse (t3 – t4). The final frame demonstrates that following bubble collapse, new
bubbles nucleated around the vacated areas of the rim. Figure 3C shows the series of the
smallest droplet with a diameter D of only ∼ 2.5 µm. For this series, multiple bubbles are
already observed at t1 ∼ 160 s. A full cycle of bubble growth and collapse across the droplet
was completed within 365 s.
From the collective series, the bubbles showed a tendency to nucleate and grow at the
droplet rim. This is in stark contrast to cavitation experiments which show highly localized
formation.54,55 The bubbles did not appear to occupy the inner portions of the droplet until
a significantly later stage of the reaction. Given the droplets are small, the product diffusion
would be rapid throughout the droplet. This result may reflect a reduced nucleation barrier
at the droplet rim, analogous to capillary condensation. The other possibility is that the
reaction rate is much faster around the droplet rim, in analogy to coffee stain effect in droplet
evaporation.58 The bubble size remained consistent throughout a range of droplet sizes. It
is observed and rationalized through geometric confinement that fewer bubbles fit along the
droplet perimeter as the droplet size reduces. In addition, the bubbles were forced to occupy
7
the increasing proportion of the droplet.

processing. Individual bubbles are highlighted in assorted colours. Scale bar = 2 µm.
The bubbles appeared earlier in smaller droplets, as shown in Figure 4. Classical nucle-
ation theory typically dictates a non-linear relationship for the probability of bubble nucle-
ation, which in this case, is complicated by both droplet geometry and chemical reaction.
Here, a linear slope is shown to indicate the general trend over this window of droplet size.
Given that H2 is a product of the reaction, with time the reaction should drive oversatu-
ration within the droplet and eventually induce nucleation and growth of surface bubbles.
Moreover, the rate of bubble production should act as a proxy to track the reaction rate.
Although the abundance of literature reports acceleration reaction rates in droplets,22,25,27,32
our results show that there is enhancement in the nanobubble production rate due to the
reduction in the droplet size. The bubble formation within such confined liquid domains
8
demonstrates several intriguing features in this complex colloidal system. The subtleties
in bubble dynamics will be discussed below. Then we will focus on the growth of singular
bubbles, free of coalescence will be utilized to determine the dependence of the nanobubble
growth rates on droplet size more quantitatively.

Nanobubble dynamics
The dynamical behaviours of nanobubbles around the droplet rim are captured with
increased temporal resolution. Figure 5 highlights the appearance and disappearance of in-
dividual bubbles. Figure 5A-B show that the bubbles often collapsed with radii less than
0.5 µm, before interacting with other bubbles. Conversely, in Figure 5C-E, some larger bub-
bles shown formed by coalescence. The coalescence of bubbles is indicated by dashed green
circles. Following coalescence, bubble morphology may become elliptical in nature, indicat-
ing the initial bubbles were strongly pinned. Figure 5E captures the process that following
coalescence, the bubbles may then collapse. It is expected that the bubble collapse was
induced by rupture of the thin polymer film between the gaseous and aqueous phase. Upon
this rupture, a significant increase in Laplace pressure would be expected. Here interfacial
tension γpmh−air is ∼ 20 mN/m and γwater−air is ∼ 72 mN/m. The collapse of nanobubbles

may induce significant damage to underlying materials.59 The droplet deformation is pre-
sented in Figure 5F-G. Following coalescence induced collapse, the droplet perimeter is seen
to be locally concave. A similar series is shown in Figure 5H, where the droplet perimeter is
highlighted in purple. Following collapse, the droplet edge receded inwards, suggesting the
bubble was occupying the space in the droplet. The later frames of this series demonstrate
that bubbles may coalescence into a bubble that becomes large enough to engulf and detach
the droplet. The bright and fluorescence images in Figure 5I,J clearly show that inside a
reacting droplet, larger nanobubbles are near the rim while small nanobubbles are forming
from the inner area.
How fast nanobubbles evolve with time is closely related to the reaction conditions. At
a high concentration of NaOH, dramatic differences in nanobubble dynamics were observed.
After addition of NaOH, the droplets appeared to rapidly reduce in size and detach from the
substrate. It is suspected that the rapid production of gas, as well as the bubble collapse,
provides sufficient force to detach the droplets from the substrate. Representative images of
this process are shown in Figure S1. The result at higher concentration of NaOH is indicative
of further increases to the reaction rate, although the exact rate was very difficult to measure
in our current experimental setup. These results indicate that the bubble formation at
the rim only occurs within a range of reaction conditions with a mild level of hydrogen
oversaturation.
Dependence of nanobubble growth rate on droplet size
To further investigate the correlations between reaction conditions and production of
nanobubbles, the growth rate of bubbles in various droplet sizes were determined. The
droplet size is defined as the initial droplet radius before reaction and any of the observed
changes shown in Figure 3 & 5. The change in droplet size due to the reaction is presented
in Figure S2 and shows a negligible change within the growth time of each bubble. The
nanobubble growth was determined by particle tracking as shown in processed image in
Figure 3D, following the same procedure in our recent work.46 Due to the resolution and
11
noise of the measurements, linear fits were utilised to quantify the growth rate. Further,
we find that due to the collapse of bubbles, the window of their growth is well described
by linear slopes, as presented in Figure S3. Figure 6A-C, shows a representative bubble
growth as radius vs time for bubbles formed in a droplet with the radius ∼ 5, 3 and 1
µm, respectively. From the plots, the radius of nanobubbles steadily increased until a final
radius of ∼ 500 nm. Notably, the time taken to reach the maximal radius progressively
decreases with reduction in the droplet size, yielding growth rates of ∼ 3.1 nms−1, 4.5 nms−1
and 49 nms−1, respectively. The average growth rate as a function of the droplet size was
determined and plotted in Figure 6D. The average growth rate revealed a strong dependency
on droplet size, namely, that the bubble growth rate was accelerated in smaller droplets. The
best exponential fit, demonstrates rate scales as rate ∼ r−1.6d . That said, rd
−1 can also fit
the experimental closely within the accuracy of our experimental measurements.
To investigate the dependency of bubble growth rate on the concentration of reagents,
the concentration of [NaOH] in the surrounding medium was increased two fold to 0.098 M.
Representative plots of bubble radius with time are shown in Figure 7A-B. The growth rate
was determined to ∼ 5.9 nms−1 and ∼ 11 nms−1 within a droplet of radius approximately
6 µm and 4 µm, respectively. The reaction rate increased by more than two fold, compared
to Figure 6A-C indicate, as reasonably expected. Again, the growth rate was observed to
be faster within smaller droplets. This increase in rate is again demonstrated in the plot of
the average bubble growth rate vs droplet size shown in Figure 7C. Once again the average
bubble growth rate demonstrated a strong correlation to rate ∼ r−1d and best fit r
−1.3
d . In
both cases, the error bar is larger for smaller droplets, which is expected given the relative
increase in spatial noise.
Given that NaOH is acting as a homogeneous catalyst, the rate law may also be described
as Rate = k[PMH][OH−]. Then considering that aqueous volume is magnitudes larger than
the volume of PMH, [OH−] will remain constant. It should then be expected that the reaction
rate may be normalized by [OH−]. The normalized rate is shown in Figure 7D, showing an

The accelerated reactions within pure droplets suggest that the accessibility of OH− to
the droplet interface plays a determinant role within this reaction. Considering a typical
14
Langmuir isotherm,60 the rate of adsorption of hydroxide to the interface can be described
as kads[OH]f , where f is the area fraction available for adsorption and is defined as f = (1 -
θ), where θ describes the droplet surface area already occupied by droplet-OH intermediates.
The results shown in Figure 7 indicate the adsorption of hydroxide to the interface was not
saturated. Upon saturation, it would be expected that the rate become zero order with
respect to [OH].
The experiments were typically recorded over a period of 60 – 90 min. From observations
at later stages, it became evident that the growth rate of the bubbles dramatically slowed,
reducing by a factor of ∼3 after ∼45 minutes due to a consumption of reagents and accu-
mulation of the product as shown in Figure 8. After some time, it was also observed that
the smallest droplets depleted themselves and no longer liberated bubbles. The reduction
in reaction rate may be compounded by changes in the polymer within the droplet. During
reaction the polymer chain is hydrolysed yielding reactive silanol groups. It is suspected that
some crosslinking of the polymer may occur with sufficient time, impeding the reactivity of
remaining functional groups.

To investigate the effect of PMH concentration on the reaction rate, solvent exchange was
performed using a mixture of non-reactive oil decane and PMH. As shown in Figure 9A, the
15
reaction rate of the droplets consisting of decane and PMH again showed strong correlation
to r−1d . That said, the reaction of composite droplets revealed a reduced bubble growth
rate, indicating the reaction was dependent to the concentration of PMH in the droplets.
Furthermore, the coefficient Q was obtained from fitting bubble growth rate by ∼ Qr−1d ,
yielding the ratio Qpmh/Qcomposite of ∼ 16. In other words, the reaction was ∼ 16 times
slower for decane - PMH composite droplets. Based on our recent work,43 the composition
of the surface droplets was determined to be masspmh/massdec ∼ 0.073, corresponding to
a ∼ 14 times dilution. Considering the reaction to be first order with respect to PMH,
this dilution factor correlates well with reduced reaction rate. From Figure 9B, the reaction
within the composite droplets also slowed with time, reducing by a factor of 2-3, after 40
minutes of reaction, suggesting concentration of PMH within the droplet had also reduced
by a factor 2-3..

Proposed mechanism for enhanced nanobubble growth
Our results under various conditions show that the bubble growth rate was all acceler-
ated with reducing droplet radius within the range of ∼ 0.5 – 9 µm. A number of factors
can contribute to the enhanced growth rate. Given that the volume of droplets was not
16
reducing rapidly, the concentrating of reagents with decreasing droplet size as observed in
electrosprays, can obviously be excluded. Our droplets can be regarded as a pure reagent,
at least at the initial stage of hydrogen production.
This dependence of the bubble growth rate on r−nd is in agreement with earlier reports
where the increase in reaction rate increases with r−nd , which was attributed to a thermo-
dynamic advantage from the adsorption and desorption of species at the interface.11,25 That
said, there are important factors which differentiate the reaction here to those studies. In
those early reports, all reactants were internal to the droplet, whereas here the reaction is
occurring between two phases, at the liquid-liquid interface. This biphasic reaction is also
considered to be irreversible and never reach equilibrium. Considering stochastic nature of
bubble nucleation, our experimental results show strong correlation between bubble growth
rate and the droplet radius, expanding the scope of enhancement by reduced droplet size to
nanobubble production.
The scaling of bubble growth rate with r−nd is rationalized as below. As the reaction is
biphasic, taking place only at the surface of the droplet. The rate can be expressed in terms
of the interfacial area (Adroplet) as:
dm(g)
dt
= Adroplet ∗ k ∗ [PMH]d[OH−]s (1)
Here the chemical reaction shown in Figure 1 follows a second order rate law while k is as-
sumed to be a reaction constant. None of [PMH], [OH−] or k varies with the droplet size. The
amount of hydrogen produced per unit time is proportional to the area of the droplet surface
Adroplet (∼ r2droplet). The produced gas from the reaction on the droplet surface diffuses out
to increase the concentration of the dissolved hydrogen Cg in the boundary layer adjacent to
the droplet surface. During the period of incubation, the concentration of hydrogen Cg in the
boundary layer increases with time. The liquid volume in the boundary layer is proportional
to the droplet size, scaling with r3droplet. In per unit time the concentration of the dissolved
hydrogen Cg in the boundary layer increases with Adroplet∗k∗ [PMH]d[OH−]s/Vdroplet, which
17
leads to Cg ∼ r−1droplet.
Growth rate of a sphere bubble in an oversaturated environment was analytically cal-
culated by Epstein and Plesset,61 and recently reviewed by Lohse and Zhang.62 Assuming
bubble growth is governed by the ideal gas, Young-Laplace and diffusion equations.,62 the

With
α =

Cg − Cs(1 + 2σ/(rP0)
1 + 4σ/(3rP0))
(3)
Here D is gas diffusion coefficient, ρ the density of the gas, Cs the gas solubility, σ the
surface tension of the gas-liquid interface, P0 the ambient pressure. There are two limiting
cases of big and small bubbles to simplify α.62 For large bubbles, Laplace pressure inside
the bubble is much smaller than the ambient pressure. For r(t) � 2σ/P0, α ≈
D(Cg−Cs)
ρg
.
Although the size of nanobubbles here is small, the condition may not necessarily satisfy
r(t) � 2σ/(P0Cg/Cs) because of Cg/Cs � 1. So the growth rate of these nanobubbles
may be closer to the case of large bubbles. Given the gas concentration Cg ∼ r−1droplet, it is
immediately clear that α and the growth rate of nanobubbles ∼ r−1droplet. The exact growth
rate of hydrogen nanobubbles can be more complicated than a free bubble, due to geometrical
derivation from a sphere, pinning effect from the substrate and the confinement from the
droplet surface.
The above analysis would suggest that the bubble growth rate should decrease with time
as the concentration of PMH decreases from depletion in the reaction at the droplet surface.
The initial growth rate of nanobubbles also decreases with the ratio of PMH to non-reactive
liquid in the droplets, as observed experimentally. It is interesting to note that for surface
droplets, as the contact angle and thus the surface-to-volume ratio may be tuned. This may
18
prove desirable in future mechanistic or kinetic control studies for nanobubble growth rates.
Conclusions
Hydrogen nanobubbles produced from reactive polymer nanodroplets demonstrate an accel-
erated growth rate as the droplet radius is reduced. The bubbles demonstrated a preferential
nucleation at the drop rim and revealed numerous growth dynamics including coalescence,
collapse, and secondary nucleation. It was determined that the growth rate of the bubbles
scaled inversely with the droplet radius. Furthermore, the reaction rate was proportional
to both the concentration of reactants inside and outside the droplet. The experimental
results simultaneously demonstrate the production of surface nanobubbles within pure reac-
tive reagent and composite droplets. The mechanism for the enhanced growth rate was the
confinement of oversaturated gas in the droplet volume as the gas production from the in-
terfacial reaction is proportional to the surface area of the droplet. The results invite future
research toward droplet accelerated reaction, in particular, where the droplet may also con-
tain a catalyst. The findings from this study provide further understanding for applications
in droplet enhanced chemical reactions and the on-demand liberation of hydrogen.
Experimental method and simulations
Chemicals and Materials
Polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMH) (Mn = 3400 g/mol, Sigma) and decane (99%, Sigma)
were utilized as to prepare reactive oils and were diluted in acetone (AR, Chem-supply) to
prepare the first solution for solvent exchange. Sodium hydroxide (98%, Sigma) and Milli-Q
water (18 MΩcm) were used to prepare basic solution to trigger the reaction. 8-well plates
with bottom glass substrates (Lab-Tek, No. 1.5H) were used following chemical vapour
deposition of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane (97%, Sigma). The substrates
were used immediately following sonication in Isopropanol (AR, Chem-supply) and drying
19
by compressed nitrogen. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
Droplet preparation and reaction conditions
PMH droplets were prepared by solvent exchange within the well. The first solution was
prepared as 1% PMH in acetone (v/v), termed solution A. The second solution was Milli-Q
water (18 MΩcm), termed solution B. Initially 0.2 ml of solution A was added to the well,
followed by 0.6 ml of solution B. Upon addition of solution B, the solution was immediately
cloudy, indicative of nanodroplet formation from ouzo effect. From the solution 0.2 ml was
then removed and replaced by 0.2 ml of fresh solution B. This process was repeated 12 times
to remove solution A thoroughly, then leaving a final well volume of 0.5 ml. PMH in solution
A was removed in the experiments, reducing light scattering and allowed the reaction to be
visualized within the surface droplets on the same plane with the glass substrate.
Composite nanodroplets consisting of PMH and decane were prepared by the solvent
exchange in the well by following the same procedure for formation of PMH nanodroplets.
Solution A was 0.91 vol. % decane and 0.01 vol. % PMH in acetone while solution B was
water. Composite nanodroplets of PMH and 1-octanol were also prepared by the solvent
exchange in the well by following the same procedure for formation of PMH nanodroplets.
Solution A was 0.91 vol. % 1-octanol and 0.01 % PMH in acetone while solution B was
1-octanol saturated water. Both decane (99%) and 1-octanol (99%) were purchased from
Sigma and used as received. The reaction for producing hydrogen nanobubbles was initiated
by addition of the aqueous solution of NaOH into the well. The volume of the solution was
25 µl to the concentration of the alkaline solution of ∼ 0.05 M in the well during the reaction.
The physical parameters for the oil droplets are summarized in Table 1. The viscosity µ
of PMH is ∼ 45 cSt while the composite viscosity is estimated to be ∼ 4 cSt assuming an
ideal mixture. The interfacial tensions with air and water demonstrated a downward trend
with increasing PMH content. The macroscopic contact angle (CA) with air and water and
the fluorinated substrate were ∼ 60◦ for both oil compositions.

The interfacial surface tensions and contact angles were determined by pendant and sessile
droplet method using a goniometer (OCA20, DataPhysics Instruments GmbH, Germany).
The interfacial tensions were determined using the ‘OpenDrop’ package for python.63 Fluid
AFM measurements were performed using an Asylum MFP-3D Bio AFM in AC mode with
an iDrive cantilever holder and BL-TR400PB tip (nominal spring constant, k = 0.02 N/m;
freq. = 7-14 kHz). Additional Fluid AFM measurements were performed using a Dimension
Icon utilizing ScanAsyst-Fluid+ tip (nominal spring constant, k = 0.7 N/m; tip radius = 2
nm). The PeakForce setpoint was maintained during all images at 334.9 pN.
The reaction experiments were recorded in situ on a Nikon N-Storm super resolution
confocal microscope (TIRF 100x, 1.49 NA objective lens). A white-light LED was used to
capture the surface of the substrate through bright-field imaging. The region of interest was
collected by an Andor iXon DU-897 EMCCD camera, at 58 frames per second with a pixel
calibration of 0.16 µm per pixel. Image analysis was performed using a combination of NIS-
Elements instrument software and homebuilt python codes, in part utilizing the open source
PIMS, scikit64 and TrackPy65 packages for python. Each frame was enhanced by filtering
and unsharp masking, before binarization. The bubbles were detected as bright, nominally
circular features. In each frame, the size, shape and position of all detected bubbles were
measured, as shown in Figure 3D. The linking of frames within allowed time and movement
parameters allows for each bubble to be assigned a unique numerical identifier through time.
i.e. A bubble in the same location in subsequent frames is identified as the same bubble.
Conversely, if the bubble collapses and is absent for a designated number of frames, any
21
new bubbles in this location is given a new numerical identifier. The fluorescence images of
reacting droplets were taken by using 488 nm laser as excitation. The droplets were binary
mixture of PMH and decane, stained by Rhodamine 6G at 5 µM. The concentration of NaOH
in the surrounding solution was 0.048 M.

Many molecular “quantum” theories, like “quantum chemistry”, conceal that they are actually
quantum-classical approaches—they treat one set of molecular degrees of freedom classically
while the remaining degrees of freedom follow the laws of quantum mechanics. We show that the
prominent “frozen-nuclei approximation”, which is often used inmolecular control communities, is
a further example for such theory reduction: It treats the nuclei of the molecule as classical particles.
Here, we demonstrate that the ignorance about the quantum nature of nuclei has far-reaching
consequences for the theoretical description ofmolecules. We analyse the symmetry of oriented and
aligned rigid molecules with feasible permutations of identical nuclei and show: The presumption
of fixed nuclei corresponds to a localized state that is impossible to create if the existence of stable
nuclear spin isomers is a justifiable assumption for the controlled molecule. The results of studies
on molecules containing identical nuclei have to be re-evaluated and properly anti-symmetrised,
because for such molecules the premise of frozen nuclei is inherently wrong: Molecular wave
functions have to obey the spin-statistics theorem twice.
1. Frozen nuclei in molecular control
It seems as if the laser control of molecular processes is a story of success. Steering
molecular motions with laser pulses on pico-, femto-, and attosecond time-scales does not
only allow for many interesting applications, such as the control of molecular orientation
and alignment,
# 1–4
the control of charge-transfer,
#5,6
or the design of molecular switches
andmolecular rotors.
# 7–9
It also puts some long-standingdebates in the theory of chemistry
back into spotlight: Can we measure orbitals and what, if anything, do they actually
mean?
# 10–21
Do molecules have a structure, and if so, can we measure it?
#22–34
How
do electrons move during chemical reactions?
#35,36
And what follows from all of this
for our understanding of chemistry? Addressing such questions is not only relevant for
developing theories of chemistry and physics to a sophisticated level. It also helps us to
better understand the complicated relationship of chemistry and quantum theory.
# 11,23,37,38
Attosecond scientists in particular have focussed on giving new answers to these fun-
damental questions. In numerous studies, they claim to have measured what standard

interpretations of quantum theory conclude is impossible to observe: Orbitals and molec-
ular structures can be seen in time-resolved experiments for many different systems,
attosecond scientists have repeatedly reported.
#5,6,35,39–45
Critical comments on such
measurements are rare,
# 10,12,14–20,46
and they usually address only the problem that any
exact electronic wave function cannot be decomposed into (anti-symmetrised) products
of one-electron wave functions: Because the “orbital approximation” is incorrect at any
level of theory, there is nothing to observe in accurate experiments.
# 10–12,16,19
Moreover,
wave functions cannot be measured directly, the popular Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum theory dictates to us.
#47
How, then, can we image one-electron wave functions
at all?
# 14,48
In this paper, we lengthen the list of arguments why some results of attosecond research
should lead sceptics to reasonable doubt. We focus, however, on a different aspect: the
classical treatment of the nuclei. Here, we argue that the “frozen-nuclei approximation”,
which is widely employed by atto-scientists,
#5,6,35,39–45
is physically incorrect formolecules
with identical nuclei. Because it is an inherently quantum-classical theory, treating the
nuclei as classical objects by fixing them in space,
#23,29
the frozen-nuclei approximation
not only violates the indistinguishability of identical particles. It also cannot account for
the consequences that follow from the symmetry properties of nuclear wave functions:
Localised rotational states are unphysical representations of molecules that exist in form
of nuclear spin isomers.
The basis for our critique is the following argument: The frozen-nuclei approximation
(implicitly) relies on a two-step mechanism. Before manipulating electrons or internal
nuclear motions, some form of external interaction, for example an electromagnetic
field, creates narrowly localised rotational states of the molecule. In the limit of infinite
nuclear masses, common models assume, such states converge to a classical configuration
with fixed nuclear coordinates,
#23,29
which then are used in simulations of attosecond
experiments.
#5,6,35,41–45
Yet, localised rotational states are unphysical if the rotational
motion can be described in terms of permutations of identical nuclei. Either these states
cannot exist because they directly violate the spin-statistics theorem; or they cannot be
created because they represent coherent superpositions of states belonging to different
nuclear spin isomers of the molecule. Hence, as long as the existence of stable nuclear
spin isomers of the studied molecule is a legitimate assumption—which is usually the
case
#49
—localised states are physically forbidden, and the frozen-nuclei approximation
fails.
To unfold our critique, we begin with a systematic symmetry analysis of the two-step
model that is the underlying assumption of the frozen-nuclei approximation by discussing
the MS groups of rigid molecules
#50–55
in electromagnetic fields. This analysis allows
us to draw some general conclusions on the existence of nuclear spin isomers for rigid
molecules, which eventually let us define the conditions for the (non-)existence of localised
states. Our inference that localised rotational states, if at all, cannot be created on the
time-scale of molecular control experiments leads us to the conclusion that the results of
recent theoretical and experimental studies on molecular control have to be modified to be
consistent with quantum theories. In particular, we call attention to the fact that adequate
electronic wave functions must be (anti-)symmetrised twice: with respect to the exchange
of electrons and with respect to the exchange of identical nuclei.

2. Symmetry and two-step mechanisms
One of the most prominent assumptions in studies on the control of molecular processes
is the two-step model. Within this model, scientists posit that it is possible to align or
orient the molecule they want to study along one or more of its principal axes, before the
molecular process they are actually interested in ismanipulated; see Fig. 1 for an illustration.
The need for such model is perfectly obvious: To successfully excite molecular motions
with light selectively, no matter if electronic or nuclear, the polarisation of the external
field relative to the molecular frame is often decisive. Therefore, to effectively control the
motion of interest, we must be able to define the polarisation angle of the external field
relative to the molecule. Simulations employing the frozen-nuclei approximation assume
that step I in Fig. 1 is perfectly realised.
In experiments on molecular control, however, molecules are typically in delocalised
rotational eigenstates before they interact with any laser pulse. Thus, the field E
1
in Fig. 1
must be able to create localised rotational states by superimposing delocalised rotational
eigenstates of the molecule, which, in turn, allow for approximating the nuclear spatial
distribution by classical coordinates. The rotational control with electromagnetic fields is
one method that offers a route to such localised states by precisely steering the orientation
or the alignment of molecules: The orientation of (cold) molecules can be effectively
controlled with static electromagnetic fields by creating “field-dressed” eigenstates;
# 1,4
employing off-resonant, femtosecond, picosecond, or nanosecond laser pulses, alignment
of molecules is achieved by exciting rotational wave packets that are well localised along
at least one of the principal axes.
#2,4
Yet, as we argue in Section 3, localised rotational states are unphysical for molecules with
identical nuclei. Basic to understanding why the frozen-nuclei approximation fails to
describe molecules with identical nuclei is a symmetry analysis of the potential that is
created by the electromagnetic fields aligning or orienting the molecule. In particular,
the structure of the MS group
#50–53
of the confined molecules is of central importance
for our argument. Therefore, we show in the following that, for any rigid molecule in
an electromagnetic field, the permutation subgroup of its MS groups, G
psms
, can be
decomposed into cyclic subgroups. Due to this partition of G
psms
, we are not only able to
conveniently analyse the rotational motions of a molecule in terms of symmetry. By using
the permutation subgroup of the MS group, we can also derive general conditions for the
existence of nuclear spin isomers of rigid molecules. We close this Section by pointing

parallel) and the anti-aligned configuration 2 (θ � π, i.e. eZ and ez ≡ ea are anti-parallel) of iodobenzene
are energetically inequivalent. If the molecule belongs to the MS groups Cn(M) or Cnv(M) with n ≥ 2, the

out why the theory of MS groups actually suggests that localised states are a reasonable
description of confined molecules, which might explain the popularity of the frozen-nuclei
approximation among theoreticians of molecular control.
A Confining molecules in space with electromagnetic fields
A group of techniques that has become widespread during the last three decades is the
control ofmolecularmotionswith electromagnetic fields. Two current standard approaches
are standing to reason to realise the presumptions of the two-step model: the orientation of
polar molecules with static electric fields,
# 1,4
and the alignment of polarizable molecules
with off-resonant, moderately intense laser pulses.
#2–4,56
Using these techniques, the
electromagnetic field confines the molecule along its main molecular axis by exciting
superpositions of field-free rotational eigenstates.
For the approach using static electric fields to work, the molecule needs to be polar,
# 1,4 i.e.
it must have a permanent dipole moment µ. Here, the field-matter Hamiltonian Hor in the
quantum-classical dipole approximation writes
# 1,4
Eq.1 Hor � −µ·E .
and reduces to
Eq.2 Hor ≡ Vor � −µz · |E |· cos θ
in case the electric field E is linearly polarized. In Eq. 2, the Euler angle θ characterizes the
orientation of the molecule-fixed ez-axis with respect to the space-fixed eZ-axis.
Because the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, respectively, is time-independent, the field
creates a potential Vor that causes the orientation of the molecule. We can quantify its
Page 4 of 38 July 23, 2020

effect by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation

with Hrot being the rotational Hamiltonian of a rigid molecule. As a result, we obtain
the pendular energies Epen and the pendular states Φpen as a function of the Euler angels
θ, φ, χ. At least for low pendular energies, pendular states are highly confined in θ,# 1
and it is thus possible to orient the polar molecule along the space-fixed eZ-axis. In Fig. 2,
we show the potential for orienting iodobenzene
#57
as an example.
If the molecule does not have a permanent dipole moment, it is still possible to confine it
in space such that the premises of the two-step model are approximately true. Properly
designed, off-resonant, moderately strong laser pulse with envelope � are capable of
creating alignment of molecules in space.
#2–4,56
If the central frequency of the pulse is
far detuned from any molecular transition and the optical cycles are much faster than a
typical (classical) rotation period of the molecule, the relevant field-matter Hamiltonian
Halg reduces to#2,3,58

As Eq. 4 shows, the field interacts with the dynamic polarizability α of the molecule, and
the only relevant part of the laser field is the envelope �(t).
In case of a laser pulse linearly polarised in the space-fixed eZ-direction, or a laser pulse
circularly polarised in the space-fixed (eX , eY)-plane, Eq. 4 reduces to#59
Eq.5 Halg � a

In Eq. 5, a � 1/2 for a circularly polarised field, and a � −1 for a linearly polarised
field, respectively; the Euler angle θ specifies the angle between the principal axis ez
corresponding to the largest or smallest moment of inertia and the polarisation axis of the
field; the Euler angle χ defines the angle between the section line of the eX eY-plane and
ex ey-plane and the molecule-fixed ey-axis; and the quantities
αzx ≡ αzz − αxxEq.5a
αyx ≡ αy y − αxxEq.5b
are the generalized, molecule-fixed polarisability anisotropies of the molecule. Hence,
for this approach to work, the molecule under investigation must have non-vanishing
polarisability anisotropies. Solving the time-dependent Schrödinger

makes it possible to study the effect of the interaction Eq. 5 on the rotational motions of
the molecule.
If the duration of the aligning laser pulse is much longer than a typical (classical) period of
rotation, we can consider the envelope of the field to be constant over the time-scale of
rotations. This, in turn, allows us to use the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics to
solve Eq. 6. Then, the time-dependent envelope �(t) in Eq. 5 can be replaced by the peak

of the laser pulse, thus making all Hamiltonians in Eq. 6 time-independent.
The field-free rotational states then adiabatically evolve into pendular states Φpen, similar

.
Consequently, the eigenstates of the “field-dressed” Hamiltonian Hrot + Valg can fully
describe the alignment that is assumed to be perfectly realised within the two-step model.
Figure 3 shows the potential Eq. 7 for benzene for two different field strengths.
It is an interesting feature of non-resonant laser pulses that this method of molecular
alignment can be applied to polar and non-polar molecules alike. Due to the rapid
oscillations of the laser field compared to the rotational motions, the interaction term
including the permanent dipole moment of the molecule is on average zero. Hence,
the effective interaction between laser pulse and molecule is the same, no matter if the
molecule possesses a permanent dipole moment or not. In this sense, the method of non-
resonant laser pulses is more general than the approach of orienting molecules with static
electromagnetic fields. As we see in the following, however, there are subtle differences in
terms of symmetry, leading to different limitations of the frozen-nuclei approximation.
B MS groups and properties of rigid molecules
To understand why the frozen-nuclei approximation needs to be discarded for molecules
with identical nuclei, analysing the symmetry of the rotational Hamilton Hrot dressed
with the potentials Eq. 2 and Eq. 7, respectively, is crucial. A systematic and consistent
approach to the symmetry of molecules is offered by the theory of molecular symmetry
(MS) groups.
#50–53,60
The MS group is the set of all “feasible” permutations P and
Page 6 of 38 July 23, 2020
Symmetry and two-step mechanisms
permutation-inversions P∗ of identical nuclei,#52 i.e. those P and P∗ that interconvert
versions of the molecule that are not separated by insuperable energy barriers;
#53,60
see
in particular Ref. 53 for a systematic introduction to the theory of MS groups.
The field-free Hamiltonian in the electromagnetic approximation is invariant in the MS
group, so is the Hamiltonian Hrot.#53,60 Including the field-matter interactions Eq. 1 and
Eq. 4, however, might break some symmetries of the field-free molecule.
#53,55,61
From
group theoretical considerations,
#55,60–65
it follows that Halg has to be invariant in the
MS group, too, while for Hor only permutations P of identical nuclei remain symmetry
operations. Thus, for both types of interactions, the set of all feasible permutations P is a
symmetry group of the molecule in the electromagnetic field. This symmetry group is
called the permutation subgroup of the MS group, G
psms
.
#55,62–64
For rigid molecules, which are often studied in attosecond research, a general analysis of
the MS group and its permutation subgroup is possible. The MS group of a rigid molecule
is always isomorphic to the molecular point group of its equilibrium structure;
#50,51,53,66
the “quantum effects” due to large amplitude contortions are negligible on the time-scale
of the experimental technique that is used to characterize the molecule.
#53
Due to this
isomorphism, we are able to associate a classical structure to a molecule,
#23,26,67
which
is defined by the nuclear coordinates at the global minimum of the Born-Oppenheimer
potential energy surface. With the help of the irreducible representations of its (E)MS group,
we are able to uniquely classify any state of a molecule by symmetry labels.
#53,60,61,68–70
In molecular control simulations, the rotations of a molecule are often treated within the
rigid rotor model.
#53,60,61,69,70
Here, each type of rigid rotor can only belong to a specific
class of MS groups, be it a linear rotor, a symmetric top, a asymmetric top, or a spherical
top. Spherical tops, for instance, have to belong to MS groups that are isomorphic to point
groups containing rotations that are generated by at least two different C
3
axes.
#53,60
Two examples for such groups are T
d
(M) or O
h
(M). Using the results of representation
theory,
#53,71–73
we are able to deduce that spherical tops neither have a permanent dipole
moment, nor non-vanishing polarizability anisotropies. Thus, both types of interactions,
Eq. 1 and Eq. 4, are not capable of confining spherical tops. Consequently, spherical tops
are not relevant for our discussion.
All other types of rigid rotors, however, can have non-zero polarizability anisotropies or
permanent dipole moments, and we can identify the type of rotor and non-vanishing
molecular properties by knowing the MS group of the molecule. For our discussion, the
following symmetry properties of rigid rotors are relevant:
#53,60
Symmetric tops Two of the three principal moments of inertia and moments of polar-
izability are identical. One distinguishes oblate symmetric tops with
I
a
� I
b
< I
c
from prolate symmetric tops with I
a
< I
b
� I
c
. A necessary
condition for a rigid molecule to be a symmetric top is that among the
symmetry elements generating the operations of its point group is exactly
one C
n
with n ≥ 3. Hence, molecules are symmetric tops if they belong to
the groups C
n
(M), S
n
(M), D
n
(M), C
nh
(M), C
nv
(M), D
nh
(M) and D
nd
(M)
with n ≥ 3. Moreover, all molecules with symmetry group D
2d
(M) are
symmetric tops as well. For any symmetric top, the second term on the
July 23, 2020 Page 7 of 38
Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
right hand side of Eq. 5 and Eq. 7 vanishes, because the two principal
moments of the polarizability αxx and αy y are identical. Furthermore,
only if the symmetric top belongs to the groups C
n
(M) or C
nv
(M), it has
a non-vanishing permanent dipole moment. For these molecules, an
interaction of the type Eq. 1 is capable of confining them.
Asymmetric tops All three moments of inertia and principal polarizabilities are different
from each other. A necessary condition for a rigid molecule to be an
asymmetric top is that among the symmetry elements generating the
operations of its point group are only C
2
axes or no symmetry axis.
Consequently, molecules that belong to the groups C

(M), C
s
(M), C

(M),
C
2
(M), D
2
(M), C
2h
(M), C
2v
(M), and D
2h
(M) are asymmetric tops. For
this type of molecule, none of the terms on the right hand side of Eq. 5
and Eq. 7 is zero because of molecular symmetry. If the asymmetric top
belongs to the MS groups C
1
(M), C
s
(M), C
2
(M) or C
2v
(M), it also has
a non-zero permanent dipole moment, and orienting the molecule is
possible by using an interaction like Eq. 1. Molecules with symmetry
C
1
(M), C
i
(M), or C
s
(M) are irrelevant for our discussion, because they do
not contain permutations of identical nuclei except the identity.
#50,51,53
Linear molecules Two of the three principal moments of inertia and polarizability are
identical, but I
a
� I
b
� I
c
. Hence, the rotation about the bond axis cannot
be excited without the molecule being destroyed. Linear molecules either
belong to the (E)MS groups C∞v(M) or D∞h(M). The Hamiltonian for the
field-matter interaction in Eq. 5 and Eq. 7 is the same as for a symmetric
top. For our discussion, only molecules with feasible permutations of
identical nuclei are relevant; they necessarily belong to D∞h(M) with
permutational subgroup C
2
(M).#53 These type of molecules do not have
a permanent dipole moment. Moreover, it is legitimate to consider linear
molecules as a special case of symmetric top molecules, as the following
discussion shows.
Summarizing, the different types of rigid rotors can be sub-classified according to their MS
group. This allows us to make some general conclusions about the possibility of applying
the frozen-nuclei approximation, as we show in the following: If the MS group contains
pure permutations that are different from the identity, the frozen-nuclei approximation is
physically wrong and needs to be discarded.
C Confinement and symmetry: symmetric tops
Central to our argument is the structure of theMSgroupof themolecule that ismanipulated.
In particular, it is imperative that, first, we are able to decompose the MS group into
its permutation subgroup, G
psms
, and one other subgroup of order 2; and second, we
can write G
psms
as product of cyclic subgroups. As we show in Section 3, the general
structure of MS groups for rigid molecules has strong implications for the validity of the
frozen-nuclei approximation. Yet, some of the results we present in the following are not
only valid for rigid molecules but for molecules in general, as Section X, Subsection B
points out.

cal nuclei. We do not show the hy-
drogen nuclei; (12...)means carbon

Applying the frozen-nuclei approxi-
mation is equivalent to choosing one
of all possible configurations.
(a) An illustrative example: aligning benzene Let us consider symmetric top molecules first,
using the alignment of benzene as an example. Here, the potential created by the
aligning laser pulse is only dependent on θ; see Eq. 5 for αxx � αy y and Fig. 3 for a
graphical illustration. As the potential has two equivalent minima with identical energy,
two “potential-dressed versions” of benzene exist, one corresponding to the aligned
configuration (θ � 0, i.e. eZ and ez ≡ ec are parallel) of benzene and one belonging to its
anti-aligned version (θ � π, i.e. eZ and ez ≡ ec are anti-parallel).
In the field-free theory of MS groups, different versions of molecules are defined as distinct
ways of labelling the identical nuclei of a rigid structure that cannot be mapped onto each
other by a rigid rotation. Recently, we have shown that the potential-dressed versions can
be understood similarly if we take into account that, in the presence of a electromagnetic
field, the isotropy of space is broken.
#65
If the external potential that is created by the
field has minima that are interconverted by permutations, permutation-inversions and/or
elements of the spatial rotation group K spa, they belong to different physical situations
that are separated by potential barriers. This justifies to call them different—potential-
dressed—versions of the molecule. As for the versions of molecules in the field-free theory
of MS groups, certain presumptions have to be justified to define them properly.
#65,74
For symmetric tops, however, to each potential-dressed version there exist more physically
equivalent nuclear configurations than just the two that Fig. 3 shows. As Fig. 4 illustrates,
the two potential-dressed versions are not unique: The permutation (123456), for example,
changes version to 1 to 1
′
, for which the configuration in θ is the same, but χ is changed to
χ + π/3. SinceValg is independent of χ, configurations with primes are not separated by
potential barriers, and the pulse cannot control the motion in χ. Yet, to each primed and
non-primed configuration belongs a different set of rotational coordinates, which represent
different classical nuclear configurations of the molecule. Applying the frozen-nuclei

approximation, and thus fixing all nuclear coordinates, is identical to single out one of
these configurations.
Using the MS group D

(M) of benzene allows for a systematic analysis of all equivalent
configurations. This group decomposes according to

#50,51,53
If the molecule is non-rigid, Eq. 11 needs to be
extended.
#52,53,77
In Section X, Subsection A, we comment briefly on the rules of how to
map Oms on the familiar point group operations Opg. Rigid molecules are special in so far
as each one of the operations Oms can be mapped exactly on one operation of the point
group, Opg, and vice versa.#50,51,53
To understand why the frozen-nuclei approximation is physically wrong, only the equiva-
lent rotations in Eq. 11 are relevant. For the elements of the permutational subgroup, G
psms
,
of a rigid molecule, each of the permutations can be mapped on a different equivalent
rotation.
#50,51
Principally, two different types of rotations exist, Rπα and R
β
z . Their meaning
is the following: Rβz is a rotation through β radians about the molecule-fixed ez-axis; Rπα
is a rotation through π radians about an axis in the ex ey-plane making an angle α with
the ex-axis.#53 Both types of equivalent rotations change the set of Euler angles (θ, φ, χ)
according to

Geometrical realisations of the MS groups of rigid
molecules. Left column: The groups Cn(M) are
generated by cyclic permutations reflecting the
rotation about the main principal axis ez . If we
allow for inversions, we obtain the groups C
nh
(M).
If we allow for permutation-inversions that cor-
respond to reflections at planes including the
main principal axis, we arrive at Cnv(M). If we
allow for operations that can be mapped on ro-
tations perpendicular to the main principal axis,
we obtain the groups Dn(M) (without inversions)
and D
nh
(M) (with inversions). Right column: The
group S
2n
(M) is generated by the simultaneous
cyclic permutation-inversion representing the im-
proper rotation of the corners of two staggered
regular polygons about the main principal axis ez .
If we further allow for permutations that can be
mapped on rotations perpendicular to the main
principal axis, we obtain the groups D
nd
(M). The
labels 1 ... n represent identical nuclei or identical
groups of nuclei.
Hence, each of the permutations in Eq. 10a and Eq. 10b changes the rotational configuration
of the molecule in the laser field according to Eq. 12a, or Eq. 12b. The operations of the
group C
6
(M) correspond to rotations Rβz about the molecule-fixed ez axis. Considering
(123456), for example, Req � Rπ/3z . Hence, the operations of C6(M) do not change the
potential-dressed version 1 or 2, but their superscript; say 2
′ → 2′′ if we choose again
(123456) as an example. The operations of C⊥
2
(M), however, change the potential-dressed
version of benzene, because for (14)(23)(56), Req � Rπ
π/2; see Fig. 4 for an illustration.
If we write out the direct product, Eq. 10, it turns out that twelve different configurations
of benzene exist.
#53
Six of them correspond to the aligned version of benzene, 1, . . . , 1′′′′′,
and six of them belong to the anti-aligned version of benzene, 2, . . . , 2′′′′′. If scientists apply
the frozen-nuclei approximation, they choose only one of these twelve configurations for
their theoretical description. This would not be much of a problem if a localised state,
being well defined at one of the twelve equivalent configurations, could be prepared by
some form of interaction. Yet, as Section 3 shows, such state cannot exist.
(b) Generalizations: polarizable symmetric tops The results for benzene can be generalized
to any rigid symmetric top if we take into account the general structure of point groups.
Using the results from literature,
#53,54
we can divide the MS groups of molecules into
three types:
Type-I MS groups that contain only permutations.
Type-IIa MS groups that contain permutation-inversions and can be written as

MS groups that are isomorphic to the point groups C
n
and D
n
are MS groups of type-
I.#53,54 Because they only contain permutations, the permutational subgroup Gpsms is the
improper subgroup of the MS group; they are identical. One presentation of the MS group
C
n
(M) is# 75
Eq.14 C
n
(M) �
〈
1 � (1, 2, ..., n)
�� 1n � E〉 ,
and it can be understood as the group of simultaneous cyclic permutations of the corners
1, 2, ..., n of a regular n-sided polygon; see Fig. 5 for an illustration.# 75 The group D
n
(M)
writes
Eq.15 D
n
(M) � C
n
(M) o C⊥
2
(M) ,
whereas the presentation of C
n
(M) shows Eq. 14 and C⊥
2
(M) can be written as
C
⊥

(M) �

(M) �
〈
1⊥ � (2, n)(3, n − 1)...(n+1/2, n+1/2 + 1)

The labels in Eq. 16a and Eq. 16b have the same meaning as in the case of C
n
(M); they
enumerate the corners 1, 2, ..., n of a regular n-sided polygon; see also Fig. 5.# 75
By convention, it is the ez-axis about which the molecule rotates if the permutations
(1, 2, ..., n) from Eq. 14 are applied to the (set of) identical nuclei 1, 2, ... n.#53,71,72,76,78
For symmetric tops, the choice of the main principal axis is unique; by definition, there
exists only one principal axis that reflects the permutations (1, 2, ..., n) with n ≥ 3.#53
Consequently, the operations (1, 2, ..., n) do not change the orientation of themolecule-fixed
ez-axis, and hence, the orientation of the molecule with respect to space-fixed eZ-axis. If
applied k-times, they do change, however, the configuration in χ according to#53
Eq.17 χ→ χ +
2π
n
k .
As Eq. 17 shows, the operations of C
n
(M) rotate one primed classical configuration to a
different primed configuration, but they do not change the potential-dressed version from
1 to 2 or from 2 to 1. By contrast, in case the molecule belongs to the MS group D
n
(M), the
operations from Eq. 16a and Eq. 16b do change the potential-dressed version from 1 to 2 or
the other way around. Consequently, for molecules with C
n
(M)-symmetry the operations
of the permutation subgroup G
psms
only change the configuration in χ, while formolecules
with D
n
(M)-symmetry the operations of Gpsms change the configuration in χ and in θ. In
both cases, classical molecular structures are interconverted by the permutation of (groups
of) identical nuclei.
Lets turn to the case of symmetric top molecules with a MS group of type-IIa . In this
category fall the groups C
nh
(M) and D
nh
(M), because they can be written as#54,76
C

(M) � C
n
(M) ⊗ {E, E∗}Eq.18a

Here, the groups C
n
(M) and D
n
(M) are identical to the permutation subgroups of C
nh
(M)
and D
nh
(M), respectively. Consequently, considering the permutation subgroup Gpsms
Page 12 of 38 July 23, 2020

of the MS group only, the same conclusion as for molecules with MS groups C
n
(M) and
D
n
(M) apply to molecules with C
nh
(M) and D
nh
(M) symmetry, respectively.
The structure of the groups S
n
(M), C
nv
(M) and D
nd
(M) is more difficult. They belong
to MS groups of type-IIb and cannot be written as a direct product of their permutation
subgroup and the inversion group, like Eq. 13a. Yet, these groups decompose according
to

In all cases, Eq. 19a, Eq. 19b and Eq. 19c, the permutation subgroups are, again, isomorphic
to the groups C
n
(M) or D
n
(M). MS groups that are isomorphic to the improper rotation
groups S
2n
(M)with even n are exceptional: They can be written neither as a direct nor a
semi-direct product of their permutation subgroup and one other subgroup of order two.
Since these groups are cyclic, however, their permutation subgroups are necessarily cyclic
as well; they are isomorphic to C
n
(M). As we show in Section 3, this is the only argument
we need to prove that the frozen-nuclei approximation is physically incorrect.
The groups C
⊥
s
(M) and C
i
(M) in Eq. 19a, Eq. 19b, and Eq. 19c are both of order two, and
they contain besides the identity only one permutation-inversion. For the groups D

and C

(M), one presentation of C⊥
s
(M) is
Eq.20 C⊥

where the generator 1⊥ is

if n is even, and
1⊥ �(2, n)(3, n − 1)...(n+1/2, n+3/2)(n + 2, 2n)(n + 3, 2n − 1)...(3n+1/2, 3n+3/2)∗Eq.21b
if n is odd. The presentation of the group C

with n necessarily being odd;
#54,75,76
see also Fig. 5.
Hence, as in case of the groups C
nh
(M) and D
nh
(M), the only groups that are relevant for
our discussion are C
n
(M) and D
n
(M), and considering the permutation subgroup only,
the results for molecules with MS groups S
n
(M), C
nv
(M) and D
nd
(M) are the same as for
molecules with C
nh
(M), D
nh
(M), C
n
(M), and D
n
(M) symmetry, respectively. While the
operations of C
n
(M), c.f. Eq. 14, interconvert classical nuclear configurations that belong to
different values of χ, the operations of the group C⊥(M), see Eq. 16a and Eq. 16b, transform
different potential-dressed versions into one another.
As pointed out in Subsection C of this Section, in terms of their alignment symmetric top
molecules are very similar to linear molecules. Not only the potential, Eq. 7, is identical
for both type of rotors; see Fig. 3. The structure of the permutation subgroup of their
MS groups are identical, too. Setting n � 1 in Eq. 15, only the group C
⊥
2
(M) remains as a
symmetry group. Yet, this group is identical to the permutation subgroup of the D∞,h(M),

configuration can be mimicked by a localised state.
which is the MS group of a linear molecule with two identical ends. Hence, the operation
(12) of this group changes the potential-dressed version of the linear molecule from 1
to 2 and vice versa. The difference between symmetric tops and linear molecules is that
for linear molecules only the two potential-dressed versions exists; there are no primed
configurations for linear molecules. All other deliberations, however, are the same for both
types of rigid rotors.
(c) Generalizations: polar symmetric tops – and beyond A discussion of orienting polar symmet-
ric tops leads to analogues results. For being able to orient molecules with an interaction
of such as Eq. 1, the manipulated molecules must have a permanent dipole moment. As
standard text books report,
#53,71–73
this is only possible if the molecule belongs to the
MS groups C
n
(M) or C
nv
(M), see Eq. 14, Eq. 19a, Eq. 20, Eq. 21a, and Eq. 21b for their
presentations. Further, only the set of permutations of identical nuclei—and thus, only
G
psms
—remains a symmetry group of the system “molecule in electromagnetic field”,
because the HamiltonianHor is no longer invariant under permutation-inversions P∗.#53,55
The difference in energy for the aligned and anti-alignedmolecule that Fig. 2 shows reflects
the loss in symmetry. Thus, there is only one potential-dressed version for polar symmetric
tops; configuration 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 are no longer energetically equivalent.
Yet, there exist n − 1 primed configurations corresponding to the minimum of Vad in
Eq. 2 that are transformed into each other by permuting (groups of) identical nuclei. Let
us consider nitrogen trifluoride, NF
3
, with MS group C
3v
(M), which is an example for
a symmetric top with permanent dipole moment; see also Fig. 6. Even in its oriented
configuration with θ � 0, there exist two more energetically configurations with

Both also belong to the potential minimum at θ � 0, and they are interconverted by
the permutations (123) and (132). In general, the number of permutationally equivalent
configurations with θ � 0 is identical to the order of C
n
.

Symmetry and two-step mechanisms
Figure 7
Contour plot of the adiabatic potential for
the alignment of an asymmetric top. De-
pending on the symmetry, the four different
minima at (θ � 0, χ � 0), (θ � π, χ � 0),
(θ � 0, χ � π), and (θ � π, χ � π), belong
to four different potential-dressed versions
of the molecule; see Fig. 8 for the example of
tetrafluoroethylene. If the barriers between
the minima are sufficiently low, observable
tunnelling among the different versions oc-
curs.
Since theHamiltonian Eq. 2 is identical for symmetric andasymmetric tops, the same results
apply to molecules with C
2v
(M) and C
2
(M) symmetry. Hence, for orienting asymmetric
tops, we arrive at the same conclusion: The potential-dressed version associated with the
minimum of the potential Eq. 1 is not unique. Two configurations in χ exist, which both
belong to the minimum at θ � 0. Figure 2 illustrates this result for iodobenzene with MS
group C
2v
(M).
Thus, for a dipole-type interaction such as Eq. 1, distinguishing the type of rotor is not
necessary. The result is the same for all of them: As long as they posit a permutational
symmetry with respect to the exchange of identical nuclei, the minimum of the potential
Eq. 1 cannot be identified with one classical nuclear configuration alone. There exists at
least one more classical arrangement of the nuclei that also corresponds to this minimum
and that results from the exchange (of groups) of identical nuclei.
D Confinement and symmetry: asymmetric tops
Asymmetric tops have, in general, a lower symmetry than symmetric tops. The asymmetric
tops that we are interested in have MS groups D
2h
(M), D
2
(M), C
2h
(M), C
2v
(M), or C
2
(M)
only. This lower symmetry changes the potential for the alignment, as Eq. 5 and Fig. 7
show: If an asymmetric top is subject to a linearly-polarised laser pulse, the potential
created by the field has four equivalent minima, each being distinguished by different
classical configurations (θ, χ). In particular, primed versions of the molecule are now
separated by potential barriers, too.
(a) Another illustrative example: tetrafluoroethylene This ismaybe best seen by example. Figure 7
shows a contourplot of the potential for aligning an asymmetric top. For tetrafluoroethylene,
the four equivalent minima correspond to four different potential-dressed versions, which
are all separated by potential barriers created by the laser field. Depending on the barrier
height, which is proportional to the field strength, tunnelling between these four versions
might not be observed on the time-scale of the experiment.

. The operations (12)(34), (14)(23)(56),
and (13)(24)(56) transform the potential-dressed version 1 into
the three potential-dressed versions 1
′
, 2, and 2
′
, respectively.
Hence, each of these permutations corresponds to a different
equivalent rotation. Moreover, each potential-dressed version
can be represented by a state being localised in the particular
minimum.
Analysing the potential with the MS group shows that the four configurations are inter-
changed by the elements of the permutational subgroup of the MS group of tetrafluo-
roethylene. The MS group for tetrafluoroethylene, C
2
F
4
, in the electronic ground state is
the same as for ethylene, which is D
2h
(M). This group can be written as
Eq.24 D
2h
(M) � Gpsms ⊗ {E, E∗}
with
Eq.24a Gpsms � D
2
(M) � {E, (12)(34), (13)(24)(56), (14)(23)(56)} ;
see Fig. 8 for the meaning of the permutations. Due to its structure, see Eq. 24, the MS
group of tetrafluoroethylene belongs to the MS groups of type-IIa . Moreover, the group
D
2
(M) decomposes according to#54
Eq.25 D
2
(M) � C
2
(M) ⊗ C⊥
2
(M) � {E, (12)(34)} ⊗ {(13)(24)(56), (14)(23)(56)} ,
where both subgroups, C
2
(M) and C⊥
2
, are cyclic.
Figure 8 illustrates how the elements of D
2
(M) transform the potential-dressed version
1 into the other three potential-dressed versions 1
′
, 2, and 2
′
, respectively. Hence, each
permutation from D
2
(M) belongs to a different equivalent rotation of the molecule. As in
case of symmetric tops, applying the frozen-nuclei approximation is the same as choosing
one of the four potential-dressed versions for describing the molecule. The difference
between the two types of rotors is that between primed and non-primed versions a potential
barrier exists, which might hinder the rotation about the molecule-fixed ez-axis.
(b) Generalizations: polarizable asymmetric tops For molecules with MS group D
2
(M), C
2h
(M),
C
2v
(M) or C
2
(M) similar conclusions hold. If the molecule belongs to D
2
(M), the results
are the same as for molecules with D
2h
(M) symmetry. Because only permutations matter
for our argument, and both D
2h
(M) and D
2
(M) have identical permutation subgroups, for
molecules with D
2
(M) symmetry, too, there exist four potential-dressed versions that are
interconverted by the operations of G
psms
.
Page 16 of 38 July 23, 2020
Symmetry and two-step mechanisms
In case of molecules with MS group C
2h
(M), C
2v
(M), or C
2
(M), the argument is less strict.
All groups have the same abstract permutation subgroup, namely
Eq.26 Gpsms[C
2h
(M)] � Gpsms[C
2v
(M)] � C
2
(M) � {E, (12)} ,
where
Eq.27 C
2h
(M) � C
2v
(M) � C
2
(M) ⊗ {E, E∗} .
If the main principal axis is the ez-axis, the operation (12) interchanges version 1 and 1′
as well as version 2 and 2
′
; see Fig. 7. Going from minimum 1 to minimum 2, however,
cannot be described in terms of permuting identical nuclei, although the minima 1 and
2 are systematically degenerate. The reason for that is the rigid-rotor approximation,
according to which all asymmetric tops belong to the symmetry group D
2
.
#53
Hence, even
though the symmetry of the molecules is lower, the rigid rotor approximation imposes
the symmetry group D
2
, and the minima on the potential that is created by the field are
the same as for a molecule with D
2
(M) or D
2h
(M) symmetry. Yet, also for molecules with
C
2h
(M), C
2v
(M), or C
2
(M) applying the frozen-nuclei approximation is still equivalent to
choosing one out of two potential-dressed versions of the molecule.
E Why the frozen-nuclei argument works: localised states
Studies on molecular control employing the two-step approach commonly use low-
dimensional models, which assume that the molecule is perfectly oriented along one of its
principal axes; see Fig. 1.
#64
The argument theoreticians use for eliminating most of the
nuclear degrees of freedom in their models is that these motions can either be adiabatically
separated from the manipulated degrees of freedom, or they can be considered as frozen
on the time-scale of the studied process; see Refs. 64 and 79 for an elaborated discussion.
In particular, they assume that it is legitimate to consider the molecule as being trapped
in one potential minimum if only the strength of the external field is high enough. To
calculate the time-evolution of the studied system, it is therefore sufficient to consider only
the nuclear coordinates at one of the equivalent minima of the external potential.
A rationale for this argument gives the theory of MS groups, which is based on quantum
tunnelling theory and the concept of structural degeneracy.
#53
If the potential barriers
between the n
ver
minima representing n
ver
structurally degenerate versions of the molecule
is sufficiently large, the (low-lying) nuclear spectrum contains only sets of n
ver
quasi-
degenerate energy eigenvalues. Hence, if the energy splittings within these sets are so
small that they cannot be resolved in the experiment that is used to study the molecule, we
can limit our theoretical considerations to the vicinity of only one of the n
ver
minima.
#60
Then, all permutations and permutation-inversions interconverting the n
ver
versions are
useless for understanding the molecular spectrum and for characterizing electronic wave
functions, as they lead to redundant selection rules. Consequently, it is sufficient to only
consider the set of “feasible” nuclear permutations and permutation-inversions rather than
the full nuclear permutation inversion group for analysing the molecular spectrum.
#53,60
Quantum dynamicists, however, not only care for energies, but they also study the time-
evolution of molecular wave packets evolving on the potential energy surface. Thus,
they have to modify the argument:
# 79,80
Because the tunnelling times between different
versions are much longer than the process we are interested in, we can form particular
July 23, 2020 Page 17 of 38
Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
linear combinations of eigenstates such that they are localised in one of the n
ver
structurally
degenerate minima. Hence, it is sufficient to only consider wave functions that are localised
in the vicinity of one minimum, and when describing the time-evolution of molecular
states, we can then use a local Schrödinger equation that contains a truncated potential
only.
Both arguments are, at least implicitly, the starting point of quantum chemical and
spectroscopic studies on the one hand, and the description of the quantum and classical
dynamics of molecules on the other hand.
#80
But they also apply if molecules are subject
to a strong external potential: If the potential barriers created by the external interaction are
sufficiently high, energy splittings due to tunnelling between different potential-dressed
versions of the molecule cannot be resolved. Hence, it is legitimate to consider only
one minimum of the potential when calculating the spectrum of the molecule in the
potential; see Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 for the aligning potentials of a symmetric and asymmetric
top, respectively. Likewise, we can describe the quantum dynamics of the system in terms
of states that are localised in one minimum, being linear combinations of wave functions
belonging to quasi-degenerate energies.
Thus, if this assumption is right, it seems to be only a small approximation to replace the
localised nuclear wave packet by a single “frozen” nuclear configuration. If the potential
barriers are insuperable, and the process we want to describe is fast compared to the
hindered rotational motion of the nuclei, this configuration will not change much on the
relevant time-scale. Hence, the frozen-nuclei approximation appears to be reasonable
as long as the rotational motion of the nuclei is slow compared to the time-scale of the
studied phenomenon.
This reasoning, however, is wrong. To begin with, our discussion in this Section shows that
freezing the nuclei was only valid if all classical configurations in the rotational coordinates
are separated by insuperable barriers. Thus, for symmetric tops, aligning or orienting the
molecule would be not sufficient to apply the frozen-nuclei approximation. All primed
configurations of symmetric top molecules are not separated by barriers at all, see Fig. 3 for
the example of benzene, and there are no reasonable grounds for assuming that choosing
one primed configuration is legitimate; see in particular the discussion in Subsection C of
this Section.
Yet, there are more problems with this rationale, even if it was possible to separate each
classical configuration by insuperable barriers created by some sort of external interaction.
In particular, the localised rotational states on which low-dimensional models are relying
cannot be realised. As we show in Subsection C and Subsection D of this Section, in many
cases going from one structurally degenerate minimum of the external potential to another
is equivalent to permuting identical nuclei. Under these circumstances, however, localised
states are unphysical. Because they are linear combinations of eigenstates belonging
to different nuclear spin isomers, they cannot be formed by an external interaction on
reasonable time-scales, as we show in the following.
Page 18 of 38 July 23, 2020
Symmetry and two-step mechanisms
3. Frozen nuclei and localised states
Recently, we have extended the list of shortcomings molecular dynamics simulations
entail. For internal molecular motions that can be described in terms of permutations of
identical nuclei, such as torsions and pseudo-rotations, molecular dynamics simulations
are inherently wrong. They (implicitly) presuppose that a localised wave packet is an
adequate description of the quantum motion the simulations are supposed to mimic. For
cyclic contortional motions, however, such states are unphysical.
# 79
In the following, we show that for the frozen-nuclei approximation identical conclusions
hold. It implicitly assumes that localised states are physical representations of quantum
systems, but for molecules with identical nuclei such states represent superpositions of
(eigen-)states belonging to different nuclear spin isomers. Thus, if the nuclear spin isomer
hypotheses is legitimate, localised states must be discarded as physical descriptions of the
molecule—and hence, the frozen-nuclei approximation.
It turns out that these similarities are not a coincidence: both concepts, molecular dynamics
and the frozen-nuclei approximation, are based on a theory reduction rather than an
approximation. By limiting the motion of nuclei to trajectories with or without zero
momentum, they treat the nuclei as classical particles, and they therefore cannot account
for effects that are inherently quantum mechanical.
A A definition of nuclear spin isomers of molecules
According to the spin-statistics theorem, any molecular wave function Φmol must be either
symmetric (ζmol � +1) or anti-symmetric (ζmol � −1) if two or more identical nuclei are
permuted, where the character ζmol depends on the spin of the permuted nuclei and
the order of the permutation. Consequently, molecular wave functions must transform
according to an irreducible, one-dimensional, and real molecular representation Γmol
in the complete nuclear permutation group, G
cnp
.
#53
Since not all permutations cause
observable tunnelling splittings, however, classifying molecular wave functions according
to the permutation subgroup of the MS group, G
psms
, is sufficient.
#52,53,77
For most molecular systems known so far, writing any molecular eigenstate Φmol as
Eq.28 Φmol � Φrcve·Φnu.sp ,
is an excellent approximation.
#49,53,81–83
In Eq. 28, Φrcve denote the eigenfunctions for the
rotational-contorsional-vibrational-electronic motions of the molecule, and Φnu.sp are the
wave functions describing its nuclear spins.
The nuclear spin isomer hypotheses combines the assumption Eq. 28 and the spin-statistics
theorem: If nuclear spin conversion effects are negligible, molecules exist in form of nuclear
spin isomers,
#49,82
which are determined by the equation
#53,84
Eq.29 Γmol ⊆ Γrcve ⊗ Γnu.sp .
Consequently, different nuclear spin isomers of amolecule are characterized by unique com-
binations of the irreducible representations Γrcve and Γnu.sp in the permutation subgroup
of the MS group.

Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
In experiments on rotational control, it is furthermore reasonable to assume that (i) the
rotations separate adiabatically from the remaining motions of the molecule;
# 1,3,79
and (ii)
any external laser field does not manipulate the quantum states of the other motions.
# 1,3,79
Under these conditions, we can formally average over the electronic and vibrational
coordinates and replace Φmol by the model wave functions# 79
Eq.30 Φmod � Φrot(θ, φ, χ)·Φnu.sp(Σ) .
In Eq. 30,Φrot are the rotational (eigen-)functions, which are dependent on the Euler angles
θ, φ, χ, andΦnu.sp denote the nuclear spin eigenstates as a function of the collective nuclear
spin variable Σ. If the assumptions (i) and (ii) are both acceptable, the wave functions
describing the rotational motion are, or can be expanded into the eigenfunctions of a
symmetric top.
#53
Both the rotational and the nuclear spin functions in Eq. 30 individually
form a basis for the irreducible representations of the permutation subgroup of the MS
group.
#53,60
Using the adiabatic ansatz of separated molecular time-scales and focussing on the
rotational motion of the nuclei, Eq. 29 reduces to
# 79
Eq.31 Γmod ⊆ Γrot ⊗ Γnu.sp .
In Eq. 31, Γmod, Γrot, and Γnu.sp are spanned by the (symmetry-adapted) wave functions
Φmod, Φrot, and Φnu.sp, respectively. As in the general case, Eq. 29, the irreducible
representation Γmod in Eq. 31 is fixed and dictated by the spin-statistics theorem. Hence,
the nuclear spin isomers of the rotating nuclear frame are unambiguously defined by a
combination of rotational and nuclear spin symmetries, which we denote as Γrot[Γnu.sp]
hereafter.
B On localised rotational states in external potentials
To generalize our earlier results for cyclic, one-dimensional, contortional motions of
non-rigid molecules
# 79
to the rotations of rigid molecules, we distinguish two cases: (i)
the permutation subgroup of the MS group of the rigid molecule is cyclic; and (ii) the
permutation subgroup of the MS group can be decomposed into cyclic groups. In both
cases the results are the same: (partially) localised states are superpositions of states
belonging to different irreducible representations of cyclic subgroups of the permutation
subgroup of the MS group.
(a) The permutation subgroup of the MS group is cyclic In the simplest case, Gpsms is identical to
the group
Eq.32 C
n
(M) �
〈
1 � (12 . . . n)
�� 1n � E〉 ,
where 1 denotes the generator of C
n
(M); E is the identity; and n gives the number of
(groups of) identical nuclei that are permuted as the molecule rotates. Because C
n
(M)
is cyclic, the irreducible representations Γ of this group are all one-dimensional.# 73 As
Section 2, Subsection C and Subsection D show, G
psms
has exactly this structure if the rigid
molecule belongs to the MS groups C
nh
(M), C
nv
(M), C
n
(M), or S
2n
(M).
Let us consider NF
3
as an example. In the electronic ground state, this molecule belongs to
theMSgroupC
3v
(M)withpermutation subgroupC
3
(M).#60 Hence, n � 3 in Eq. 32 andone
generator of this group is (123); see Fig. 6 for an illustration. In case themolecule is oriented,
Page 20 of 38 July 23, 2020
Frozen nuclei and localised states
three localised states exist; they belong to the same field-dressed version, but to different
classical configurations (θ
1
, χ
1
), (θ
1
′ � θ
1
, χ
1
′ � χ
1
+ 2π/3), and (θ
1
′′ � θ
1
, χ
1
′′ � χ
1
+ 4π/3).
Applying the frozen-nuclei approximation is equivalent to choosing one of the three. The
permutation (123) interconverts the three configurations; see Fig. 6. Thus, applied to a
state Φloc
1
localised at (θ
1
, χ
1
), the operation (123) generates a state Φloc
2
that is localised at
χ
1
+ 2π/3, while (123)(123) gives a state Φloc
3
that is localised at χ
1
+ 4π/3.
The localised statesΦlocj , j � 1, 2, 3, are linear combinations of symmetry-adapted rotational
states, i.e. states that transform irreducible in the group C
n
(M). This follows from the
fact that any field-dressed state created by the field can always be expanded in terms of
symmetry-adapted symmetric top eigenfunctions

expansion coefficients of the n

J
−m ,−k represents
Wigner’s small d-matrix.
#85
Using the projection operator technique,
# 73
and taking into
account the transformation properties of the rotational wave functions from Eq. 33 in the
MS group,
#53,84
we obtain
# 79
Eq.34 Φlocj �

In Eq. 34, � j is a complex number with |� j |2 � 1, andΦrot

andΦrot
E
2
are rotational wave
functions belonging to the irreducible representations A, E
1
, and E
2
in C
3
(M), respectively,
formed by the three localised states Φlocj .
# 79
Hence, each of the three localised states is a
linear combination of symmetry-adapted states and vice versa; see Ref. 79 for a derivation.
We stress that the symmetry-adapted states in Eq. 34 are not necessarily eigenfunctions;
they might be time-dependent symmetry-adapted wave packets instead. For our argument
is only important, however, that no matter what shape the localised state has, it is always
a linear combination of three symmetry-adapted states. The only condition the three
symmetry-adapted states have to fulfil for Φlocj to be localised is
Eq.35 |Φrot
A
|2 !� |Φrot
E
1
|2 !� |Φrot
E
2
|2 .
Hence, all symmetry-adapted states contribute with the same weight to any of the three
localised states.
These arguments are valid for any arbitrary cyclic G
psms
: For a system with the symmetry
group C
n
(M), each localised rotational state is a superposition of symmetry-adapted
rotational functions. Only if one symmetry-adapted state for each irreducible representation
contributes with the same weight to Φloc in the sense of Eq. 34, the state is localised exactly
at one classical configuration.
# 79
(b) The permutation subgroup of the MS group decomposes into cyclic groups In general, the group
G
psms
is not cyclic. Rigid molecules whose permutation subgroup is not cyclic itself have to
belong to theMS groups D
n
(M), D
nh
(M), or D
nd
(M), as our analysis in Section 2 shows. Yet,
in all of these cases, the permutation subgroup G
psms
is isomorphic to D
n
(M), which can
always be decomposed into cyclic subgroups, see Section 2, Subsection C and Subsection D.

2
(M) can be mapped on the equivalent rotation Rπα ,
only changing φ and θ; see Eq. 12a and Eq. 12b, respectively, and Subsection A of the
Appendix.
Due to the decomposition of the permutation subgroup, see Eq. 36a and Eq. 36b, and
the form of the rotational basis functions, c.f. Eq. 33, we can generalize the results from
the last paragraph. Because the rotational basis functions are a product of functions
being dependent on only one rotational coordinate, we can analyse the symmetry and the
localisation of the rotational wave functions separately in each coordinate and each cyclic
subgroup of G
psms
.
A simple example is aligned C

configurations—1, 1

—are separated by the potential created by a linearly-
polarized aligning field; see Fig. 8 and the discussion in Section 2, Subsection D. The
permutation subgroup G
psms
is D
2
(M); see Eq. 24 and Eq. 24a. As it is clear from Fig. 7
and Fig. 8, the operations of
Eq.37a C
2
(M) � {E, (12)(34)}
interconvert field-dressed version 1 and 1
′
, only changing χ to χ + π. Conversely, the
operations of
Eq.37b C⊥
2
(M) � {E, (14)(23)(56)}
change field-dressed version 1 to field-dressed version 2 and θ to π − θ, respectively.
For the localisation in χ, the result is the same as for NF
3
: Any rotational wave function
that is localised in χ is a superposition of symmetry-adapted rotational functions, clas-
sified according to the subgroup C
2
(M) of the permutational subgroup with irreducible
representations Aχ and Bχ.

Consider two states Φloc

Consequently, the two localised functionsΦloc

Analogously, we can consider two states Φloc

that are localised in minimum 1

.Eq.43b
Hence, also rotational states being localised in θ are superpositions of symmetry-adapted
states, if classified according to the irreducible representations of C
⊥
2
(M).
What we have shown here for C
2
F
4
is valid for any rigid molecule whose permutation
subgroup, G
psms
, decomposes into cyclic subgroups. In general, the ensemble of localised
states that are interconverted by the operations of one cyclic subgroup is a basis for the
regular representation of this group;
# 79
they generate a representation that contains each
irreducible representation of the group once and with equal weight. Consequently, it is
always possible to construct symmetry-adapted rotational states out of localised rotational
states, and each of these symmetry-adapted rotational states is a superposition of all
localised rotational states that are interconverted by the operations of the respective cyclic
subgroup of G
psms
.
# 79
Moreover, the functions that transform irreducible in the cyclic subgroups of G
psms
, such
as Eq. 39a, Eq. 39b, Eq. 42a, and Eq. 42b, do not have to transform irreducible in the
permutation subgroups or the full MS group. To show that localised states are unphysical
representations of molecules with feasible permutations of identical nuclei, it suffices
to proof that they are linear combinations of functions that transform irreducible in the
subgroups C
n
(M) and C⊥
2
(M), as the following discussion shows.

Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
C The impossibility of localised states revisited
So far we have only shown that localised rotational states are superposition states of
different symmetries, if they are classified according to cyclic subgroups of the permutation
subgroup of the MS group of the molecule. To make plausible why they represent
unphysical states of the molecule, we need to discuss the following three aspects:
1) If the nuclei that are permuted by the operations of a cyclic subgroup of Gpsms carry
zero spin, only one nuclear spin isomer exists in this subgroup. If the nuclei carry
non-zero spin, every possible nuclear spin isomer exists, i.e. every symmetry-allowed
combination of nuclear spin states and spatial states is realised.
2) If the nuclei that are permuted by the operations of the cyclic subgroup carry zero spin,
localised states are symmetry-forbidden. If the nuclei carry non-zero spin, spatially
confined nuclear wave packets are superpositions of eigenstates belonging to different
nuclear spin isomers.
3) If couplings and correlations between nuclear spins and rotational motions are neg-
ligible, and the existence of stable nuclear spin isomers is a reasonable assumption,
localised states are unphysical. They cannot be created by external interactions on
the time-scale of typical experiments on molecular control if the nuclei are treated as
quantum objects.
In the following, we focus on the physical implications each of these statements have for
the localisation of nuclei in space; the relevant proofs we have presented elsewhere.
# 79
(a) On the symmetry of nuclear spin states Let us consider the case of Gpsms being cyclic first. A
molecule forwhich the operations of a cyclic G
psms
only permutes nuclei with zero spin, the
nuclear spin functions always transform according to the totally symmetric representation,
Γ
ts
, in G
psms
.
# 79
This argument is valid even if the molecule contains nuclei with non-zero
spin, but which are not permuted by the operations of G
psms
.
If, however, the permuted nuclei carry non-zero spin, for each irreducible representation of
G
psms
, we find at least one nuclear spin function that forms a basis for this representation.
In other words, the representation that is generated by the set of all nuclear spin functions,
Γnu.sp, always contains the regular representation of Gpsms.# 79
Although the arguments in Ref. 79 are exemplified for single nuclei, they equally apply to
molecules for which the permutations of G
psms
refer to rigid fragments of the molecule,
like for iodobenzene with G
psms � C
2
(M); see Fig. 2. Then, however, the representation of
Γnu.sp is identical to Γ
ts
only if all nuclei that are permuted by the operations of Gpsms carry
non-zero spin. Otherwise, Γnu.sp always contains the regular representation of Gpsms.
If G
psms
is not cyclic, for rigid molecules, it is still possible to decompose G
psms
into cyclic
subgroups; see Eq. 36a and Eq. 36b as well as the discussion in Section 2, Subsection C
and Subsection D. Therefore, the arguments of the preceding paragraph also apply to the
molecules of this type, because we can analyse their nuclear spin states separately in each
cyclic subgroup of G
psms
.
Page 24 of 38 July 23, 2020
Frozen nuclei and localised states
An illustrative example is again C
2
F
4
. We consider natural isotopes, I(12C) � 0 and
I(19F) � 1/2, and specify every non-symmetrised nuclear spin state by the quadruplet
(mI
1
,mI
2
,mI
3
,mI
4
) with mIi � ±1/2; see Fig. 8 for the labelling of identical nuclei. These
sixteen nuclear spin states form a basis for the representations of the groups C
2
(M) and
C
⊥
2
(M) from Eq. 37a and Eq. 37b, respectively.#53,79
Consider, for example, the nuclear spin states (−1/2, 1/2, 1/2,−1/2) and (1/2,−1/2,−1/2, 1/2).
Since
(−1/2, 1/2, 1/2,−1/2)
(12)(34)
−−−−−→ (1/2,−1/2,−1/2, 1/2)Eq.44a
(1/2,−1/2,−1/2, 1/2)
(12)(34)
−−−−−→ (−1/2, 1/2, 1/2,−1/2) ,Eq.44b
they form a basis for the representation
Eq.45 Γ
nu.sp
reg,C
2
� Aχ ⊕ Bχ
in C
2
(M). Likewise, the states (−1/2, 1/2,−1/2, 1/2) and (1/2,−1/2, 1/2,−1/2) form a basis for
Eq.46 Γ
nu.sp
reg,C⊥
2
� Aθ ⊕ Bθ ,
because
(−1/2, 1/2,−1/2, 1/2)
(14)(23)(56)
−−−−−−−−→ (1/2,−1/2, 1/2,−1/2)Eq.47a
(1/2,−1/2, 1/2,−1/2)
(14)(23)(56)
−−−−−−−−→ (−1/2, 1/2,−1/2, 1/2) .Eq.47b
Consequently, for all irreducible representations in C
2
(M) and C⊥
2
(M), we find nuclear
spin states of C
2
F
4
that form a basis for these irreducible representations.
Here, we have limited the symmetry analysis of the nuclear spin states to subgroups
of G
psms
only. Properly identifying the observable nuclear spin isomers of a molecule,
however, requires the use of the full permutation subgroup of the MS group.
#62,79,80
Yet, in case G
psms
is not cyclic, we can apply the method of (inverse) correlation to relate
the symmetries of the nuclear spin states in the subgroups C
n
(M) and C⊥
2
(M) with the
irreducible representations of G
psms
.
#53
By doing so, we are able to show that the nuclear
spin functions transforming irreducible in C
n
(M) and C⊥
2
(M) can be associated with the
nuclear spin isomers of the molecule. We return to this aspect at the end of next paragraph.
(b) Localised states as superpositions of different nuclear spin isomer states The spin-statistics
theorem allows us to identify each nuclear spin function with one nuclear spin isomer,
because it only permits combinations of spatial states and nuclear spin states that fulfil
Eq. 31. Since these combinations are unique in G
psms
(and its subgroups), each spatial
state that transforms irreducible in G
psms
represents a nuclear spin isomer of the molecule.
Showing that localised states are superpositions of states representing different observable
nuclear spin isomers is straightforward for molecules whose permutation subgroup of the
MS group, G
psms
, is cyclic. A textbook example for this case is NF
3
with G
psms
� C
3
(M),
and I(14N) � 1, I(19F) � 1/2; see Fig. 6 for three classical configurations. As Eq. 34 shows,
any of the localised states identified with these classical configurations is a superposition
of rotational states of different symmetries in C
3
(M). The spin states of the three fluorine
nuclei span the representation

#86
Eq.49 A[A] E

see Eq. 31. Consequently, the three symmetry-adapted rotational functions forming the
localised states in Eq. 34 represent the three different nuclear spin isomers of NF
3
.
An illustrative example for a molecule with permuted nuclei of zero spin is CO
2
with
G
psms
� C
2
(M), and I(12C) � 0, I(16O) � 0. For CO
2
, only one totally symmetric nuclear
spin state exist. Since any molecular state has to be totally symmetric too to fulfil the
spin-statistics theorem, only totally symmetric rotational states are symmetry-allowed; see
Eq. 31. Hence, for CO
2
localised states principally cannot exist, because the existence of
rotational states belonging to different Γrot in Gpsms is a necessary condition for forming
localised states.
If G
psms
is not cyclic, but decomposes into cyclic subgroups, using the method of (inverse)
correlation allows us to show that localised states are superpositions of different nuclear
spin isomer states. In case of C
2
F
4
, for example, the full permutation subgroup of the
MS group is D
2
(M)with irreducible representations A, B
a
, B
b
, and B
c
.
#62
In D
2
(M), the
sixteen nuclear spin states of C
2
F
4
span the representation
Eq.50 Γnu.sp � 7A ⊕ 3B
a

and Eq. 31 shows us that there are four observable nuclear spin isomers of C

However, the symmetry-adapted states in Eq. 40a, Eq. 40b, Eq. 43a, and Eq. 43b, which
form the localised states in χ and θ, have been classified according to the subgroups C
2
(M)
and C
⊥
2
(M). To identify how the nuclear spin isomers from Eq. 51 are related to the spatial
wave functions in Eq. 40a, Eq. 40b, Eq. 43a, and Eq. 43b, we have to use the method of
correlation.
#53
Correlating the irreducible representations of D
2
(M) and C
2
(M) gives#62
(A, B
a
) → AχEq.52a
(B
b
, B
c
) → Bχ .Eq.52b
Hence, rotational functions with Aχ-symmetry in C2(M) represent either the nuclear spin
isomer A[A] or B
a
[B
a
], while rotational functions with symmetry Bχ in C2(M) belong to
the nuclear spin isomer B
b
[B
b
] or B
c
[B
c
]. Analogously, we can correlate the irreducible
representations of D
2
(M)with the irreducible representations of C⊥
2
(M) to find#62
(A, B
c
) → AθEq.53a
(B
a
, B
b
) → Bθ .Eq.53b
Equation 53 shows that rotational functions with Aχ-symmetry in C
⊥
2
(M) belong either
to the nuclear spin isomer A[A] or B
c
[B
c
], and rotational functions with symmetry Bθ in
C
⊥
2
(M) represent the nuclear spin isomer B
b
[B
b
] or B
c
[B
c
]. Consequently, also in case Gpsms
decomposes into cyclic subgroups, localised states are superpositions of states belonging
to different nuclear spin isomers.
Page 26 of 38 July 23, 2020
Frozen nuclei and localised states
(c) No frozen nuclei for stable nuclear spin isomers Such superpositions, however, are not
physical on the time-scales of molecular control experiments, simply because they cannot
be created deliberately.
# 79
As the discussion from the preceding paragraphs shows, to
create localised states we have to be able to superimpose rotational states of different
symmetries Γrot in Gpsms such that each symmetry-adapted state contributes with the
same weight. Two strategies are possible to excite such states within the framework of the
frozen-nuclei approximation: either by exciting rotational states of different symmetries
directly with laser fields; or indirectly by superimposing nuclear spin states belonging to
different Γnu.sp with magnetic fields. As we discuss in the following, both strategies fail.
The direct approach cannot work because of the permutational symmetry of molecules in
electromagnetic fields. If Eq. 28 is valid, exciting localised states is not possible, because
any interaction that creates superpositions of states with different Γrot in Gpsms must be
able to break the permutational symmetry of the system. Electromagnetic fields only break
the inversion symmetry, but permutations remain symmetry operations.
#55
Thus, the
permutation subgroup of the MS group remains a symmetry group in the presence of the
laser field, and the respective field-matter Hamiltonian can only couple rotational states
belonging to the same irreducible representation in G
psms
.
#55,79
Mixing rotational states
directly is therefore not possible if we assume that the rotational motions are adiabatically
separated from other molecular motions. Consequently, the first strategy for creating
localised states fails.
Although most studies on strong-field control assume Eq. 28 to be valid, the frozen-nuclei
approximation does not have to include the separation of nuclear spin states and spatial
motions. It is possible to couple rotational motions with nuclear spins, if, for example,
the dipolar interaction or the spin-rotation coupling is included in the description of the
nuclei.
#49,86
Due to the symmetry properties of the molecular tensors describing these
interactions, including them creates superposition states of different Γnu.sp—and hence, of
different rotational symmetries in G
psms
. This is the premise of the second strategy for
creating localised states.
Usually, however, couplings of rotational motions and nuclear spins are very small, and
nuclear spin conversion is an extremely slow process compared to the excitation of coherent
molecular motions.
#49,86
Although nuclear spin converting effects can be amplified with
magnetic fields,
#86
preparing superpositions of states belonging to different nuclear spin
isomers is only possible on time-scales that are much longer than the time-scale on which
molecular rotations typically take place. Hence, decoherence effects due to interactions
with the environment
#87
would jeopardize any attempt to create localised states.
#49,86
Moreover, the superpositions created by the magnetic field do not fulfil the condition
that every rotational state shall contribute with equal weight.
# 79,86
This follows from
the fact that within a magnetic field, the MS group remains a true symmetry group.
#55
As a consequence, it is not possible to directly change the nuclear spin symmetry, but
only indirectly by employing the dipolar interaction or the spin-rotation coupling. These
couplings, however, do only occur between specific combinations of rotational and nuclear
spin states, not between all of them.
#86
Thus, if at all, a magnetic field could only create a
partial localisation.

Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
For these two reasons, the frozen-nuclei-approximation fails to describe nuclei that are
confined in strong laser fields. To adequately simulate systems with hindered nuclear
motion, we either have to use properly (anti-)symmetrised rotational states, or we need to
go beyond the frozen-nuclei approximation and extend the present theories to explain
why localised rotational states are reasonable descriptions for molecules with feasible
permutations of identical nuclei. Both approaches, however, significantly deviate from the
assumptions scientists make in the context of molecular control.
D A note on non-rigid molecules
We insisted many times that the deliberations we make and the conclusions we draw in the
present paper are limited to rigid molecules. Many interesting phenomena in molecular
physics and chemistry, however, are related to molecules that cannot be described by
the concepts used for rigid molecules, be it intramolecular motions and molecular rotors,
photochemistry, or charge-transfer phenomena. To theoretically describe these non-rigid
molecules with large amplitude internal motions, many works rely on frozen-nuclei
approximations, too.
Yet, treating non-rigid molecules theoretically is far more difficult than rigid molecules:
neither a systematic analysis of their MS groups exists, nor the derivation of the zero-order
Hamiltonian is standardized. For non-rigid molecules, different procedures for defining
the molecule-fixed coordinate system have been developed.
#53,54,69,88–93
Depending on
the method, the rotational and contortional degrees have different meanings, and the MS
group might have to be modified if a specific method is used.
#82,91,93
Both the diversity
of methods and the sophisticated structure of their MS groups make general statements
about the validity of the frozen-nuclei approximation for non-rigid molecules challenging.
Still, we can argue that at least full rotational localisation is not possible also for non-rigid
molecules. Each MS group G
ms
of a molecule with large-amplitude internal motions can
be expanded according to
# 77
Eq.54 Gms � Geq ∪ ˆF
2
G
eq ∪ ... ∪ ˆFn
V
G
eq
�
n
V⋃
i�1
ˆFi Geq with ˆF1 ≡ E .
In Eq. 54, the group G
eq
is the MS group of the rigid energy minimum structure of the
non-rigid molecule; it is isomorphic to the molecular point group of the electronic energy
minimum structure.
#50,51
The operators
ˆFi transform the reference version 1 into version
i, i.e. they are permutations or permutation-inversions interconverting the n
V
versions of
the molecule that are separated by superable energy barriers.
#53,77
As the expansion Eq. 54 shows, the MS group of the rigid energy minimum structure,
G
eq
, is a subgroup of the full MS group.
#53,54,77,89,90
Due to the isomorphism of G
eq
and the respective molecular point group, the arguments we present in Section 2 and
this section also apply to the group G
eq
. This suggests that at least with respect to the
operations of G
eq
, localised rotational states are not possible for non-rigid molecules
as well: symmetry-adapted rotational states, if classified according to the irreducible
representations of the permutation subgroup of G
eq
, represent different nuclear spin
isomers of the non-rigid molecule, and superpositions of these states, such as localised
states, are unphysical representations of the molecule.
Page 28 of 38 July 23, 2020
Frozen nuclei and localised states
The problem with this argument, however, is that for a non-rigid molecule, we cannot say
with certainty what the meaning of the operations in Eq. 54 is, because their interpretation
strongly depends on the definition of the molecule-fixed coordinate system.
#53,69,88,91
Hence, solely from the structure of the MS group, we cannot conclude according to which
irreducible representations the rotational wave functions transform. There are examples of
which also the operations
ˆFi change the rotational coordinate, and not the contortional
coordinate alone.
#53,93
In a future publication, we will address this issue by discussing
examples of contemporary research on molecular torsions.
#94
A related discussion on
non-rigid molecules with observable inversions was given recently.
#95
E Freezing nuclei is not an approximation, but a theory reduction
When reading books about molecular physics and theoretical chemistry, it is almost
impossible not to be confronted with the idea that the prominent approach of Born and
Oppenheimer to calculating molecular eigenstates
#96,97
is an approximation. Yet, in the
literature on the philosophy of theoretical chemistry, it has long been argued that the
adiabatic separation of nuclear and electronic motions means more than that.
#22–27,29,98
Instead, the Born-Oppenheimer programme is better understood as aweak theory reduction
from a quantum to a classical treatment of the nuclei. By reducing the theoretical
description to classical mechanics and treating the nuclei as distinguishable objects,
molecular structures arise as an emergent—classical—property of the molecule.
#23,29
The term approximation, these papers point out, is neither mathematically
#98–101
nor
conceptionally
#23,29
correct. Mathematically, the Born and Oppenheimer is an asymptotic
expansion in terms of the ratio ς � (m/M)1/4, where m is the mass of an electron and M is
a mean nuclear mass of the molecular system. The point ς � 0 is singular and therefore
leads to a discontinuous change in the description of the molecule. Instead of treating the
nuclei as quantum objects, they are considered as classical particles in the limit of ς→ 0,
which ultimately allows us to speak of a molecular structure.
#23,29
These arguments apply to the frozen-nuclei approximation alike.
#98
Because the change
from a localised rotational state to a classical configuration is discontinuous, it is not only
incorrect to assume that it would smoothly converge into the classical configuration if
only the external interaction is strong enough; see also Section 2, Subsection E. It also
shows that the nuclei are considered qualitatively different. Since they are described as
classical objects at this level of theory, neither we can motivate the existence of nuclear
spin isomers, nor we can understand why localised states are physically wrong. Hence, if
the frozen-nuclei approximation should be of any merit for describing experiments on
molecular control, we need to make plausible why it is legitimate to describe the nuclei as
(quasi-)classical objects.
4. Conclusion: (anti-)symmetrisation is necessary—twice
In this paper, we have shown that the frozen-nuclei approximation is an unphysical
description of rigid molecules with identical nuclei. Because the quantum analogue of
frozen nuclei, a localised rotational state, is a superposition of states belonging to different
nuclear spin isomers of the molecule, it is either symmetry-forbidden, or it cannot be
July 23, 2020 Page 29 of 38
Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
created on the time-scale of typical experiments on molecular control. The deeper reason
for this inherent flaw is that the “frozen-nuclei approximation” is a theory reduction
rather than an approximation, which treats the nuclei of the molecule as classical particles.
Therefore, it cannot account for the indistinguishability of identical nuclei, the existence of
nuclear spin isomers, and the impossibility of localised rotational states.
Consequently, for molecules with identical nuclei, the conventional approaches to molec-
ular control need to be extended. An obvious example is the orbital tomography of
symmetric molecules, like CO
2
. The alleged reconstruction of molecular orbitals not
only relies on the assumption that the electronic wave function decomposes into one-
electron functions.
# 12,14,16,19–21
It also assumes that it is justified to freeze the nuclei at
their equilibrium configuration to eliminate the dependence of orbitals on the nuclear
coordinates. As our argument shows, however, this assumption is wrong. Because nuclear
wave functions have to obey the spin-statistics theorem, too, it is impossible to describe
CO
2
by a localised rotational state. Instead, rotational states must be symmetry-adapted
with respect to the operations of the permutation subgroup of theMS group, even in strong
electromagnetic fields. Yet, symmetry-adapted states are necessarily delocalised in the
rotational manifold, and hence, we have to take into account that minima corresponding
to different potential-dressed versions are equally populated. As a consequence, we must
not consider one particular classical configuration for the nuclei, but we only can, if at all,
measure orbitals that are averaged over all potential-dressed versions of the molecule.
Another area of research for which the failure of the frozen-nuclei approximation is crucial
is the contortional control of polyatomic molecules.
#64,79
Models for describing internal
motions in molecules, such as torsions or pseudo-rotations, often rely on the assumption
that slow rotational motions can be considered as frozen over the course of the simulated
contortional motion; see in particular Ref. 64 for an analysis and the references therein for
examples. Many of the studied systems, however, exist in form of distinct potential-dressed
versions, and applying the frozen-nuclei approximation is equivalent to choosing one of
them and ignoring the consequences of the spin-statistics theorem. Hence, in particular in
the context of directed motions, it is necessary to re-evaluate the premises of the models on
contortional control to judge if they can account for the impossibility of localised rotational
states.
# 74
And yet, the fact that conventional models of molecular control fail in case they rely on the
frozen-nuclei approximation is not the only conclusion we can draw from the impossibility
of localised rotational states for molecules with stable nuclear spin isomers. Under the
condition that the nuclei of a molecule can be treated as (quasi-)classical objects, our
discussion shows, the frozen-nuclei approximation is appropriate. Hence, if it was possible
to explain why such quasi-classical states of the nuclei exist, and why from all possible
basis sets spatial position plays a special role,
# 102
the localisation of molecules would
appear as reasonable assumption. The environment-induced superselection of a preferred
basis approach
#47,87
might offer such explanation.
But no matter if spatial states are preferred or not, our conclusions show that results based
on conventional models of molecular control employing the frozen-nuclei approximation
have to be treated with care. For motions that can be described in terms of permutations
of identical nuclei, models relying on localised states are ignorant about the quantum

Conclusion: (anti-)symmetrisation is necessary—twice
properties of nuclei. They cannot account forwhatmight be decisive to properly understand
the molecule under control: that nuclear wave functions have to obey the spin-statistics
theorem, too. o
X. Appendix: Some useful characteristics of MS-groups
Some of the arguments we have presented in Section 2 are not only valid for rigidmolecules,
but can be generalised to any type of MS group. Specifically, the typology of MS groups
makes it easier to identify nuclear spin isomers in particular and allows for making
conclusions about molecular observables in general.
A MS groups and point group operations
To understand the typology introduced in Section 2, it is important to recall some basic
rules on the relationship of the operations of the MS group and point group operations.
For rigidmolecules, to each permutation or permutation-inversion Oms in Eq. 11 a different
point-group operation Opg belongs. As shown by Hougen, the complete set of operations
constitutes the point-group of the rigid molecule;
#50,51
see also the book of Steinborn.
#66
Only because of this isomorphism of the MS group and the point group of the rigid
molecule, it is possible to map the operations of the MS group unambiguously on the
operations of the respective molecular point group. The rules for this mapping are as
follows: Permutations P in the MS group correspond to proper rotation operations ˆC
n
in
the molecular point group, while permutation-inversions P∗ are equivalent to improper
rotation operations
ˆS
n
. Additionally, proper and improper rotations of order n can be
mapped only on permutations and permutation-inversions consisting of disjoint cycles
with length n, respectively.
#50,51,53
It is important to understand that
ˆC
n
does not physically rotate themolecule; it only rotates the
vibronic coordinates about the molecule-fixed ez-axis by the angle η � 2π/n. Conversely, the
equivalent rotations Req change the rotational coordinates by rotating the molecule-fixed
axes. For rotations about the ez-axis, we can furthermore say: If Req � R
β
z , see Eq. 12b,
the corresponding point group operation rotates the vibronic coordinates by the angle
η � 2π − β about the molecule-fixed ez-axis.#60
For improper rotation operations, the following rules hold:
ˆS
1
≡ σ̂
mol
and
ˆS
2
≡ ˆi. Here,
σ̂
mol
is a mirror pane being perpendicular to the highest axis of rotation. For any improper
rotation of higher order,
ˆS
n
� ˆC
n
· σ
mol
, with the rules for the operations
ˆC
n
being specified
in the preceding paragraph. We stress that the inversion E
∗
does not correspond to the
inversion operation in the point group, but to the reflection at the molecular plane σ̂
mol
.
#60
Further, these rules are only valid for rigid molecules. For non-rigid molecules, a permu-
tation P or a permutation-inversion P∗ might only change the contortional coordinates,
leaving the rotational and vibronic coordinates of the molecule unaffected. Moreover,
the meaning of the operations of the MS group in terms of molecular coordinates, in
July 23, 2020 Page 31 of 38
Grohmann On the impossibility of frozen nuclei
general, depends on which method is used to set up the zero-order Hamiltonian. Unlike
for rigid molecules, the molecule-fixed coordinate system is not defined uniquely; different
definitions of this coordinate system lead to different geometrical interpretations of the
operations.
#53,91
B A typology of MS groups
As pointed out in Subsection C of Section 2, any MS group falls into one of the following
three categories: type-I, type-IIa, or type-IIb. This typology is based on how the permutation
subgroup G
psms
relates to the full MS group of the molecule.
For MS groups of type-I, this relation is simple: Gpsms is an improper subgroup of Gms
I
,
because these MS groups do not contain any permutation-inversions. For MS groups of
type-IIa, we stated that they can be written as a direct product of the permutation subgroup
and the inversion group, while for MS groups of type-IIb this is not possible. As we point
out in the following, their structure is a direct consequence of the inversion E
∗
being a
feasible operation or not.
For MS groups of type-IIa, the inversion E∗ is feasible. If E∗ is feasible, the MS group must
contain for each permutation P the corresponding permutation-inversion P∗. For the
following reason: Any permutation-inversion P∗ can be written as
Eq.55 P∗ � PE∗ � E∗P ,
where P is a pure permutation of identical nuclei. If E∗ is feasible, the element
Eq.56 E∗P∗ � E∗E∗P � P
must also be in the MS group, otherwise the group axioms would not be fulfilled.
#68
Hence, since P∗ is an arbitrary but feasible permutation-inversion, its corresponding
permutation P must be feasible, too. Since furthermore {E,E∗} and Gpsms both form
normal subgroups of G
ms
, and both have only the identity E in common, the complete MS
group can be written as Eq. 13a.
# 75
In MS groups of type-IIb, the inversion E∗ is not feasible. Here, the MS group contains
for none of the feasible permutations P the corresponding permutation-inversion P∗.
Per definition, the only way of obtaining P∗ from P is by combining P and E∗.#53 Yet,
if E
∗
is not feasible, it is not possible to obtain P∗ by combining P with any element of
the MS group. Thus, if P∗ is feasible, for MS groups of type-IIb, P is not, and vice versa.
Nevertheless, the permutation subgroup G
psms
still forms an invariant subgroup of the
MS group, but it can no longer be written as a direct product, see Eq. 13b.
Since the arguments are independent of the geometrical realization of the operations of
the MS group, the results apply to any MS group, irrespectively of the molecule being
rigid or non-rigid.

C On the irreducible representations of MS groups
The structure of MS groups has direct consequences for the labelling of their irreducible
representations. If Γα specifies an irreducible representation of the permutation subgroup,
for the irreducible representations of the MS group holds the following:
Type-I The irreducible representations of the MS group can be chosen to be identical to
Γα.
Type-IIa The irreducible representations of Gms can be labelled according to Γα,±. Here,
for the characters of Γα,±,
#53
Eq.57 ζΓα,±[P∗] � ±ζΓα,±[P] ,
and no extra degeneracies are introduced by including the inversion operation
E
∗
. Moreover, the irreducible representations of the MS group correlate with the
irreducible representations of its permutation subgroup according to
Eq.58 Γα,±
G
ms→Gpsms
−−−−−−−−−→ Γα .
Type-IIb There is no general correlation scheme between Γα and the irreducible represen-
tations of the MS group. In particular, it is possible that two (or more) irreducible
representations of G
psms
correlate with only one irreducible representation in
the MS group. Therefore, including permutation-inversions might introduce
additional degeneracies.
For identifying nuclear spin isomers, this is in particular important. Often, the states of
the molecular system can be classified in the MS group, but only using the permutation
subgroup allows for uniquely defining the nuclear spin isomers of molecules. While for
molecules belonging to MS groups of type-I or type-IIa it is still possible to uniquely define
the nuclear spin isomers of the molecule in the MS group, for groups of type-IIb this is
no longer possible. To identify the nuclear spin isomers of a molecule belonging to MS
groups of type-IIb , we then have to use the method of inverse correlation,#53,62,80; see Ref.
62 and 80 for examples.

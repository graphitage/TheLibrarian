The dissociative ionization of H+2 in a linearly polarized, 400 nm laser pulse is simulated by solving
a three-particle time-dependent Schrödinger equation in full dimensionality without using any data
from quantum chemistry computation. The joint energy spectrum (JES) is computed using a time-
dependent surface flux (tSurff) method, the details of which are given. The calculated ground
energy is -0.597 atomic units and internuclear distance is 1.997 atomic units if the kinetic energy
term of protons is excluded, consistent with the reported precise values from quantum chemistry
computation. If the kinetic term of the protons is included, the ground energy is -0.592 atomic units
with an internuclear distance 2.05 atomic units. Energy sharing is observed in JES and we find
peak of the JES with respect to nuclear kinetic energy release (KER) is within 2 ∼ 4 eV, which is
different from the previous two dimensional computations (over 10 eV), but is close to the reported
experimental values. The projected energy distribution on azimuth angles shows that the electron
and the protons tend to dissociate in the direction of polarization of the laser pulse.

I. INTRODUCTION
Understanding the three-body Coulomb interaction
problem is an on-going challenge in attosecond physics.
The typical candidates for investigation include Helium
atom and H+2 molecule. In attosecond experiments, a
short, intense laser pulse is introduced as a probe for the
measurements. Various mechanisms were proposed in
the recent decades to describe the dissociation and disso-
ciative ionization of H+2 , including bond softening [1],the
charge-resonance enhanced ionization (CREI) [2], bond
hardening [3], above threshold dissociation (ATD) [4, 5],
high-order-harmonic generation (HHG) [6] and above
threshold explosion [7]. One may find a summary of the
above mechanisms in theoretical and experimental inves-
tigations of H+2 in literature [8, 9]. Experimental studies
on the H+2 ion exposed to circular and linearly polarized
pulses for angular and energy distributions of electrons
were reported recently [10–13].
In theory, the joint energy spectra (JES) of the kinetic
energy release (KER) for one electron and two protons
of the H+2 ion are predominant observables that show
how energy distributes around the fragments, where the
JES is represented by the KER of two electrons for dou-
ble ionization (DI) [14–16]. In theory, the JES computa-
tions for double ionization in full dimensionality was very
scarce for laser pulses with wavelengths beyond the XUV
regime (≥ 400nm) because the computational consump-
tion scales dramatically with the wavelength and inten-
sity of the laser field [16]. With tSurff method, which was
first introduced in Ref. [17], full dimensional simulation
of the JES for double ionization was available with mod-
erate computational resources for 800 nm [16] and 400
nm [18] laser pulses. The tSurff method was also suc-
∗ Jinzhen.Zhu@physik.uni-muenchen.de
cessfully applied to the dissociative ionization of the H+2
ion [19, 20] in a two-dimensional (2D) model, where the
energy sharing of the photons and electron is observed in
JES.
The dissociative ionization of the H+2 ion has been sim-
ulated by many groups [10, 14, 21–26]. However, they are
all in reduced dimensionality. Quantum simulation in full
dimensionality is not available yet. Although the corre-
lation among the fragments could be observed in the 2D
model, the peaks of the JES with total nuclear KER are
always above 10 eV. This is far from experimental observ-
ables [11–13], which are usually below 5 eV. The tRecX
code, which successfully implements the tSurff method
in full dimensionality, has been applied successfully in
the simulations of the double ionization of Helium [16]
and the single ionization of polyelectron molecules [27–
31]. The dissociative ionization of the H+2 ion has not
been computed using the tRecX code from before, even
in reduced dimensionality.
In this paper, we will introduce simulations of the dis-
sociative ionization of the H+2 ion by solving the time-
dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in full dimen-
sionality based on the tRecX code. We will first present
the computational method for scattering amplitudes with
tSurff methods, from which the JES can be obtained.
Then we will introduce the specific numerical recipes for
the H+2 ion based on the existing discretization methods
of tRecX code. With such numerical implementations,
the ab initio calculation of field free ground energy of the
Hamiltonian is available. Finally we will present results
of dissociative ionization in a 400 nm laser pulse, the JES,
and projected energy spectrum on the azimuth angle.

dinates with center of the two protons as the origin are
applied. Instead of using the vector between two protons
~R as an coordinate [14, 19, 20], we specify the coordi-
nates of the protons and electrons as ~r1,−~r1 and ~r2. We
denote M = 1836 atomic units as the mass of the proton.
A. Hamiltonian
The total Hamiltonian can be represented by sum
of the electron-proton interaction HEP and two tensor
products, written as
H = HB = H
(+) ⊗ 1+ 1⊗H(−) −HEP , (1)
where the tensor products are formed by the identity op-
erator 1 multiplied by the Hamiltonian for two protons
(H(+)), or that for the electron (H(−)). HB is called the
Hamiltonian in the B region and will be detailed later.
With the coordinate transformation used in Ref. [32],
which is also illustrated in Appendix A for our specific
case, the single operator for the electron is
H(−) = −

B. tSurff for dissociative ionization
The tSurff method is applied here for the dissocia-
tive ionizations, which was successfully applied to the
polyelectron molecules and to the double emission of He
atom [16, 28–31]. In this section, we will follow a similar
procedure as is done in Ref. [16].

introduced in the double ionization of Helium in Ref. [15]
and then applied in a 2D simulation of the H+2 ion in
Ref. [19]. Without considering the low-energy free elec-
trons that stay inside the box after time propagation, we

with initial values being 0. The two tSurff radii could be
set to equivalent R

(−)
c , because all Coulomb inter-
actions are neglected when either the protons or electron
is out of the tSurff radius. According to our previous re-
searches, the spectrum computation is independent of the
Rc if all Coulomb terms are removed and the wavefunc-
tion is propagated long enough after the pulse [15, 16].
The tSurff for double emission of two particles was firstly
introduced in Ref. [15]. The above derivations are very
similar to what was reported in Ref. [16] of double emis-
sion of Helium, where the only differences are constants
before different operators, say ∆, ~O and 1
r
. Thus, detailed
formulas are omitted here and the interested readers can
refer to Ref. [15, 16].
The computation for photoelectron spectrum includes
four steps, similar to the one used in Ref. [16], detailed
as
1. Solve full 6D TDSE with the Hamiltonian in the
B region, given in Eq. (1), and write the time-
dependent surface values in the disk.
2. Advance the single-particle wave packets in the D
region by Eq. (13) with surface values given in the
B region time propagation.
3. Advance the single-particle wave packets in I region
by Eq. (14) with the surface values given in the B
region time propagation.
4. Integrate the fluxes calculated from surface values
written in the D and I regions’ time propagation
by Eq. (12).
III. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
The numerical methods here are similar to what was
detailed in Ref. [16, 18]. In fact, the code in this paper is
developed based on the double ionization framework of
the tRecX code used in the reference [16, 18]. Thus, we
will focus on the electron-protons interaction which was
not talked about before and only list relevant discretiza-
tion methods in this paper.
A. Discretization and basis functions
The 6D wavefunction ψ is represented by the product
of spherical harmonics for angular momentum and radial
functions as
ψ(~r1, ~r2, t) = ψ(r1, θ1, φ1, r2, θ2, φ2, t)
=

(19)
where Y m1l1 (θ1, φ1) and Y
m2
l2
(θ2, φ2) are the spherical har-
monics of the two electrons and the radial function is
represented by the finite-element discretization variable
representation (FE-DVR) method as
Rm1,m2,l1,l2(r1, r2, t) =
∑

where f
(n1/2)
p1/2 (r1/2) are p1/2th basis functions on n1/2th
element, and the time-dependency of the three parti-
cles are included in the radial functions and coefficients
cm1,m2,l1,l2n1,n2,p1,p2 (t), as is used in Ref. [15, 16]. The infinite-
range exterior complex scaling (irECS) method is utilized
as an absorber [33]. The tSurff expression for computing
spectra of such discretization can be found in Ref. [16].
B. Electron-protons interaction
The first part of electron-protons interaction can be
written in a multi-pole expansion as

Therein, the matrix for electron-protons interaction
could be obtained by the numerical recipes used in
Ref. [16, 34] with limited changes. Numerically, we find
λ does not need to go to infinity and a maximum value
of 8 already suffices our simulations.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A numerical convergence study shows, unlike the 6D
double emission of He, where m1/2 = 0, 0 ≤ l1/2 ≤ 2
already gives convergent ground eigenenergy [16], here
the angular quantum number 0 ≤ m1/2 ≤ 2 and 0 ≤
l1/2 ≤ 8 starts to give convergent calculations, due to the
lower symmetric property of the H+2 ion. The R
(+)
c =
R
(−)
c = 12.5 atomic units is chosen for computation, as
we find R
(−)
c does not change the quality of the spectrum
but introduces longer propagation time for low-energy
particles to fly out. R
(+)
c = 12.5 atomic units gives the
internuclear distance R = 25 as is used in Ref. [19]. The
wavefunction is propagated long enough after the pulse
for to include the unbound states low kinetic energies.
If the kinetic energy of protons is included, the field
free ground energy value is E0 = −0.592 atomic units and
the internuclear distance is 2.05 atomic units. With the
kinetic energy of protons excluded, the ground eigenen-
ergy is -0.597 atomic units, three digits exact to ground
energy from quantum chemistry calculations in Ref. [35],
where the internuclear distance is fixed. The internuclear
distance is 1.997 atomic units, three digits exact to that
from the precise computations in Ref. [36].
A. Laser pulses
The dipole field of a laser pulse with peak intensity I =
E20 (atomic units) and linear polarization in z-direction
is defined as Ez(t) = ∂tAz(t) with
Az(t) =
E0
ω
a(t) sin(ωt+ φCEP ). (28)
A pulse with λ = 400nm is given with intensities 8.3 ×
1013W/cm2 close to 2D computation in reference [19]
5
and 5.9 × 1013W/cm2 close to experimental conditions
in Ref. [12]. We choose a(t) = [cos(t/T )]8 as a realis-
tic envelope. Pulse durations are specified as FWHM=5
opt.cyc. w.r.t. intensity.
B. Joint energy spectra
The JES of the two dissociative protons and the elec-
tron is obtained by integrating Eq. (11) over angular co-
ordinates as
σ(EN , Ee) =
∫
dφ1
∫
dφ2
∫
dθ1 sin θ1
∫
dθ2 sin θ2
P (φ1, θ1,
√

√
2m× Ee),
(29)
where EN , Ee are kinetic energies of two protons and an
electron, respectively. σ(EN , Ee) is presented in Fig. 2 (a,
b). The tilt lines with formula EN +Ee = Nω+E0−Up
with Up =
A20
4m
specify the energy sharing of N pho-
tons for both the computations from 8.3 × 1013W/cm2
and 5.9 × 1013W/cm2, indicating correlated emissions
of the electron and protons, which is also observed in
the 2D computations [19, 20]. The yields are intense
around nuclear KER from 2 eV to 4 eV in the cos8 en-
velope pulse, consistent with the experimental values re-
ported in Ref. [12, 13]. The peak of JES for dissocia-
tive ionization is for lower nuclear KER than that (3-4
eV) from Coulomb explosion from ground eigenstate of
the H+2 ion, which property is also close to experimen-
tal observables [37]. The Coulomb explosion JES is ob-
tained with the same method as dissociative ionization
except that HEP is removed from B region Hamiltonian
as H
(CS)
B = H
(+) ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ H(−), but the initial state
is still obtained from Hamiltonian HB in Eq. (1). We
find that the contribution from time-propagation in sub-
region D → DI (see Eq. (13)) is small, as the numerical
error of JES δ(σ) of σ computed from S → DI, and σ′
computed from two subregions (S → DI and D → DI),
is always below 1% the main contribution of the JES
(2 < EN < 4eV ), see Fig. 2 (d). This numerical property
is also observed in two-dimensional (2D) simulations [19].
This is because the electrons are much faster than pro-
tons and the H+2 ion tends to release first.
One may find that the JES is most considerable around
2 ∼ 4eV nuclear KER, different from ≈ 0.5a.u. > 10eV
obtained in the 2D simulations. The difference can also
be observed from the Coulomb explosion computation
shown in shown in Fig. 2 (c). In experiments, the distri-
bution of emitted protons peaks at nuclear KER=4 eV
for a 780 nm laser pulse6 × 1014W/cm2 [11], Ref. [37]
reported the Coulomb explosion peak is around 3eV nu-
clear KER for a 791 nm, 9.3×1013W/cm2 laser pulse and
Ref. [12, 13] reported the nuclear KER is most probable
around 3 eV for two protons for 400 nm laser pulses.
These observables at different experimental conditions
show nuclear KERs are around 2 ∼ 4 eV, which are close

to our computations but far from the computations in
the 2D simulations [14, 19]. The deviation of the 2D
simulation may arise from its limitations for obtaining
the ground states of protons, because their rotational ki-
netic energy around the molecular center is not included,
both for electrons and protons. The existing 2D simu-
lations for the dissociative ionization put corrections to
the electron-proton interaction with a smooth factor to
give the correct ground energy of electrons H+2 [14, 19].
However, the pure Coulomb repulsion of the two protons
1/R (R is the internuclear distance) is included without
a smooth factor. The ground eigenenergy from 2D simu-
lation including the nuclear KER is -0.597 atomic units,
identical to the quantum chemistry computations, where
the nuclear KER is excluded. We would like to point out
that, for the 2D simulation, for consistency of the correc-
tion of Coulomb interaction of the electron, the Coulomb
repulsion term of the two protons may also need a smooth
factor, which needs further investigations.

for electron, where E1 and E2 are kinetic energies for an
individual proton and electron.
As is observed in Fig. 3, the probability distributions of
electron and protons reach the highest value in the polar-
ization direction, which is consistent with the experimen-
tal observations for linearly polarized laser pulses [11, 13].
The probability of the dissociative protons is most con-
siderable with 1 ≤ E1 ≤ 2eV , higher than the E1 < 1eV
for dissociative channels reported in Ref. [11, 37], but
in the range of their Coulomb explosion channel, where
the laser wavelength is 800 nm. For higher intensity
8.3 × 1013W/cm2, the angular distribution of released
protons and electron extends more in the polarization
direction. For distribution of protons, tiny yields around
3 eV in radial coordinates indicates the Coulomb explo-
sion channel, close to what is observed in experiments,
however, for different laser pulses [37].
V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS
We simulate the dissociative ionization of the H+2 ion in
full dimensionality and obtain the ground energy same as
the quantum chemistry methods. Using tSurff methods,
we obtained the JES where energy sharing is observed,
which indicates a correlation between proton and elec-
trons. The JES peaked at EN from 2 eV to 4 eV, which
is different from the previous 2D simulations, but is con-
sistent with the experimental data. The projected energy
distribution on angles shows that the electron and pro-
tons tend to dissociate in the direction of polarization of
the laser pulse.
The simulation of the single emission spectrum
showing dissociation channels, is however not possi-
ble yet. The difficulty lies mainly in constructing the
internuclear-distance-dependent electronic ansatz of H
with a given ionic state in a single emission TDSE on
~r1, which might be solved by reading the energy surfaces
from quantum chemistry calculations or another tRecX
calculation. We leave work for future studies.
FIG. 3. The log-scale probability distribution of (left col-
umn) protons by log10 pN (θ1, E1) and (right column) protons
by log10 pe(θ2, E2), θ1,2 ∈ [0, π]. The plot is symmetrized by
pN (2π − θ1, E1) = pN (2π − θ1, E1) and pe(2π − θ2, E2) =
pe(2π − θ2, E2) The upper row is computed from laser pulse
at intensity 8.3 × 1013W/cm2 and lower row represents the
5.9× 1013W/cm2. The values of the radial coordinates E1/2
are represented in eV. The polarization direction is along the
horizontal axis and the direction electric field is labeled at
each sub-figure with an arrow above ”E(t)”. The values are
all normalized by dividing the maximum value.

Appendix A: Coordinate transformation
We use sub-indices ”a”, ”b” and ”e” represent the two
protons and the electron of an arbitrary coordinate. The
sub-indices ”0”, ”1” and ”2” represent the center of the
two protons, the relative position of an proton to the cen-
ter and the electron in our transformed coordinate, re-
spectively. Suppose originally the coordinates of the two
protons and electrons are represented by vectors ~xa, ~xb
and ~xe of an arbitrary origin, respectively. The new co-
7
ordinates ~r1 and ~r2 satisfies
~r0 =
~xa + ~xb

~r1 =
~xa − ~xb

~r2 = ~xe −
~xa + ~xb

where ~r0 is the coordinate of the center of the two pro-
tons. The Laplacian of the two protons O2a,O

Motivated by the recent prediction of the Magnus Hall effect in systems with broken inversion
symmetry, in this paper we study the Magnus Nernst effect and the Magnus thermal Hall effect.
In presence of an in-built electric field, the self rotating wave-packets of electrons with finite Berry
curvature generate a Magnus velocity perpendicular to both. This anomalous Magnus velocity gives
rise to the Magnus Hall transport which manifests in all four electro-thermal transport coefficients.
In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of the Magnus Nernst and Magnus thermal Hall effect
in monolayer WTe2 and gapped bilayer graphene, using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism. We
show that the Magnus velocity can also give rise to Magnus valley Hall effect in gapped graphene.
Magnus velocity can be useful for experimentally probing the Berry curvature and design of novel
electrical and electro-thermal devices.
I. INTRODUCTION
Different kinds of Hall effects have played a funda-
mental role in unraveling electron dynamics1,2 and novel
electronic states3,4 in crystalline materials. The tradi-
tional classical1 and quantum Hall effects3 arise from the
Lorentz force which manifests only in the presence of an
external magnetic field. More recently, there has been a
growing interest in novel Hall effects which persist even
in the absence of a magnetic field. Prominent examples
are the anomalous5–7 and the quantum anomalous Hall
effect4,8–10. These primarily arise from the anomalous ve-
locity in which the Berry curvature (BC) plays a key role.
More interestingly, the BC in different materials can also
couple to the spin, valley, and orbital degrees of freedom
giving rise to the spin11–14, valley15–18 and orbital19,20
Hall effects, even when the total charge anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) vanishes. Along with these, the thermal
analogue of these Hall effects21–26 also have played a ma-
jor role in the field of caloritronics. In this paper, we
study a new kind of Hall effect, the Magnus Hall effect
(MHE)27 which relies on the BC and an in-built electric
field to generate a Magnus velocity perpendicular to both
(see Fig. 1).
For all physical phenomena related to the BC, sym-
metries play an important role. For instance, in systems
with spatial inversion symmetry (SIS) and broken time
reversal symmetry (TRS), we have Ω(k) = Ω(−k). This
leads to non-zero intrinsic AHE. In systems preserving
TRS and broken SIS, the BC satisfies Ω(k) = −Ω(−k),
leading to vanishing AHE. This vanishing AHE in sys-
tems preserving TRS with non-zero BC has motivated
the search for new manifestations of BC in such systems.
Some examples include the valley Hall effect15 and the
non-linear Hall effects28–35. Recently, there has been a
new addition to this list in the form of the MHE which
leads to a finite transverse charge transport27 varying lin-
early with the applied bias field. The crucial ingredients
needed for generating the Magnus velocity are the BC,
and an in-built electric field induced by gate voltages (see
Fig. 1). These combine to induce a transverse charge and
energy current in two dimensional systems when a bias

voltage or temperature gradient is applied.
Motivated by this recent discovery of MHE, in this pa-
per we demonstrate the existence of the Magnus Nernst
effect and Magnus thermal Hall effect. We explicitly cal-
culate all the Magnus transport coefficients in presence
of an in-built electric field in TRS invariant and SIS bro-
ken systems, such as monolayer WTe2 and gapped bilayer
graphene. We find that the Magnus velocity can also give
rise to Magnus valley Hall effect in gapped graphene. We
also show that the Magnus Hall transport coefficients sat-
isfy the Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law at
low temperature. The rest of the paper is organized as
follows. In Sec. II we use the semiclassical Boltzmann
transport formalism to discuss the Magnus Hall conduc-
tivities (MHCs) in the diffusive regime, followed by a
ballistic description in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we present an-
alytical and numerical results for three different systems:
gapped graphene, monolayer WTe2 and bilayer graphene.
This is followed by discussion in Sec. V and finally we
summarize our results in Sec. VI.

II. MAGNUS HALL COEFFICIENTS IN THE
DIFFUSIVE REGIME
We start with the description of the Magnus Hall trans-
port in the diffusive regime. A schematic of the experi-
mental set up is shown in Fig. 1 and it has two impor-
tant ingredients. First, a slowly varying electric potential
energy U(r) is introduced along the length of the sam-
ple (x-axis). Such a potential energy can be introduced
by means of two gate voltages, namely UL and UR with
∆U ≡ UL − UR, as shown in Fig. 1. This creates an in-
built electric field Ein = e
−1∇rU in the device, where −e
is the electronic charge. Second, we need crystalline ma-
terials in which the self-rotation of the electronic wave-
packets gives rise to a finite BC, Ω. Additionally, there
is an applied electric field E, or temperature gradient
(∇rT ) between the source and drain, which drives the
electric or energy current.
The equations of motion of the carriers wave-packet
(for the coordinates of the center of mass) in such a sys-
tem are given by36,37
~ṙ = ∇k�k + [∇rU + eE]×Ω , (1a)
~k̇ = −∇rU − eE . (1b)
Here, �k is the energy dispersion. The first term in
Eq. (1a) is the semiclassical band velocity, the second
term is the Magnus velocity, ~vmagnus = ∇rU×Ω, which
is the focus of this work, and the third E×Ω term is the
anomalous velocity. For a two dimensional system in the
x-y plane, the BC is always in the z-direction. Hence, for
the experimental set-up shown in Fig. 1, both the Magnus
and the anomalous velocity will be along the y-direction.
The non-equilibrium carrier distribution function,
f(r,k) can be obtained from the Boltzmann transport
equation. Within the relaxation time approximation, it
is given by38
∂f
∂t
+ k̇ · ∂f
∂k
+ ṙ · ∂f
∂r
= −f − f0
τ
. (2)
Here, f0 is the equilibrium distribution function and τ
is the scattering time. For simplicity, we will consider τ
to be momentum independent. In the steady state, i.e.,
∂f/∂t = 0, without any external bias (E,∇rT = 0), the
equilibrium distribution function is given by the Fermi
function,
f0(k, r) =
1
1 + eβ[�(k,r)−µ̄]
. (3)
Here, we have defined β = 1/(kBT ), �(k, r) = �k + U(r),
and µ̄ is a fixed electro-chemical potential. It can be
easily checked that Eq. (3) satisfies Eq. (2). The tag of
equilibrium, even in presence of the gate voltages, is sup-
ported by the fact that both the longitudinal and trans-
verse charge and energy currents vanish. Now, in the
presence of a finite bias perturbation, we can obtain the
steady state non-equilibrium distribution function up to
linear order in the bias fields to be
f = f0 + vxτ
(
eEx + β [�(k, r)− µ̄] kB∇xT
)
∂�f0 . (4)
Here, we have defined the x-component of the band ve-
locity as ~vx ≡ ∂kx�k and ∂� ≡ ∂/∂�k.
The charge current j and the heat current J, can be
calculated by integrating the carrier velocity or energy
velocity multiplied by the non-equilibrium distribution
function over the Brillouin zone. Ignoring the orbital
magnetization induced anomalous contributions39–41, the
currents are given by,
{j(x),J(x)} =
∫
[dk] ṙ {−e, [�(k, x)− µ̄]} f(k, x) . (5)
Here, we have denoted [dk] ≡ dkxdky/(2π)2 for brevity.
In systems with TRS, the anomalous Hall velocity in the
ṙ terms cancel out, and does not yield any current. Thus,
the currents in Eq. (5) will have two contributions, one
from the semiclassical band velocity and the other from
the Magnus velocity.
We can obtain the expressions of Hall transport coef-
ficients using jy = σyxEx − αyx∂xT and Jy = ᾱyxEx −
κ̄yx∂xT . The conductivities are obtained from spatially
averaged currents, as described in Appendix A. Now, it
is straight forward to separate out the band velocity con-
tribution and the Magnus velocity contribution in the
transport coefficients. The band velocity contributions
are given by

vyvx ∂�feq. (6)
Here, we have defined �̃ ≡ �k − µ and feq ≡ f0(U =
0, µ̄ = µ), where µ is the constant chemical potential.
The superscript implies that these contributions are in-
dependent of the in-built electric field.

Here, L is the length between the gates shown in Fig. 1.
Equation (7) gives the MHC which was first proposed
in Ref. [27] in the ballistic regime. Equation (8) is for
the Magnus Nernst conductivity and Eq. (9) yields the
Magnus thermal Hall (or Righi-Leduc) conductivity. The
MHCs are proportional to the in-built electric field. In
contrast to the AHE6,42, they depend on the derivative
of Fermi function and are a Fermi surface property.
The form of Eqs. (7)-(9) clearly shows the Magnus Hall
transport coefficients also satisfy the Mott relation as well
as the Wiedemann-Franz law25,38,39,43. More specifically,
αm = −

Note that these relations are valid only when the chemical
potential is much greater than the temperature energy
scale38.

III. MAGNUS HALL TRANSPORT IN THE
BALLISTIC REGIME
In this section, we discuss the Magnus Hall trans-
port in the ballistic regime. In the device geometry of
Fig. 1, the external bias field creates an imbalance in the
electro-chemical potential of the source (µ̄s = µ̄ + ∆µ)
and the drain (µ̄d = µ̄). Similarly, the application of a
temperature gradient results in the source temperature
Ts = T + ∆T and the drain temperature Td = T . In the
ballistic regime, we have τ → ∞, and consequently the
distribution function is given by the collision-less Boltz-
mann transport equation27,
∂f
∂t
+ k̇ · ∂f

The non-equilibrium distribution function can be ex-
pressed as f = f0 + f1, where the equilibrium part is
given by Eq. (3) and the non-equilibrium part f1 is cal-
culated below.
Working in the linear response regime in terms of ∆µ,
we rewrite Eq. (11) as
− ∂U
∂x
∂f1
∂kx
+
∂�k
∂kx
∂f1
∂x
= 0 . (12)
For a small spatial variation of U , the first term can be
neglected, and we get a spatially independent f1. Fur-
thermore, since only the carriers from the source with
positive velocity are allowed in region 0 < x < L, the
non-equilibrium part of the distribution function can be
obtained as
f1(k, r) =
{
−∆µ∂f0 − �(k,r)−µ̄T ∆T∂�f0 for vx > 0 ,
0 for vx < 0 .
(13)
We note the resemblance of Eq. (13) with its diffusive
counterpart, Eq. (4). These equations become identical
if one identifies the scattering length vxτ with the device
length L, ∆µ/L with electric force −eEx and ∆T/L with
−∇xT , the temperature gradient.
As discussed for the diffusive regime, the Hall transport
coefficients will have two different contributions. The co-
efficients originating from the band velocity can be ex-
pressed as

Similar to the diffusive regime, the Magnus Hall trans-
port coefficients in the ballistic regime also obey the Mott
relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law.
Having established the existence of the Magnus Nernst
and Magnus thermal Hall effect, we now use Eqs. (15)-
(17) to obtain the analytical as well as numerical results
for the transport coefficients for three different systems.
IV. MAGNUS HALL TRANSPORT IN MODEL
SYSTEMS
We now calculate the Magnus Hall coefficients for three
different systems: gapped graphene, monolayer WTe2,
and bilayer graphene. All the three systems are time
reversal invariant and SIS broken and thus they host non-
zero BC.
A. Gapped graphene
A simple SIS broken system in which the Magnus Hall
transport can be demonstrated is gapped graphene, with-
out trigonal warping44–46. It has a finite BC, and its low
energy model is isotropic. Mostly familiar for its val-
ley contrasting features, the low energy valley resolved
isotropic Hamiltonian of this system is given by 15
H(k) =

σz . (18)
Here, σi are the Pauli spin matrices denoting the pseudo-
spin, τz = ±1 denotes the valley degree of freedom and
∆g is the bandgap at each valley induced by the breaking
of the sub-lattice symmetry44.
The SIS breaking introduces finite BC in the system,
which has opposite sign for the two valleys. The momen-
tum space distribution of the BC in the valence band is
given by
Ωz(k) = τz
3a2t2∆g
2[∆2g + 3a

. (19)
Using this, we calculate the Magnus Hall conductivities
from Eqs. (15)-(17). For each valley, including the spin
degeneracy, we obtain

(20)
The Magnus Hall contributions are opposite in the two
valleys, yielding an overall zero Magnus current. How-
ever, similar to the case of valley Hall effect15, here we
will have a Magnus valley Hall effect with the carriers of
opposite valley index accumulating on the different ends
of the sample. Such an accumulation of the valley Hall
carriers will persist over the diffusion length (typically
∼ 1µm) from the boundaries.

in absence of tilt (A = 0). Panel (b) shows the BC density
and Fermi surface at µ = −0.35 eV. The green portion of the
Fermi surface contour represents vx > 0 and the black portion
represents vx < 0. We have chosen other parameters to be
B = 1.0, δ = −0.25, vy = 1.0 and D = 0.1 in eV.
Since the BC for the two valleys has opposite sign,
we can have a finite Magnus Hall current for a valley
polarized system with different chemical potential in the
two valleys 47,48. More explicitly, for chemical potential
µ+ δµ/2 of valley τz = 1 and µ− δµ/2 of valley τz = −1,
we obtain the total conductivity to be

This will generate a transverse charge or energy current
for a longitudinal perturbation (bias voltage or tempera-
ture difference), which will be observable if the width of
the device region is smaller or comparable to the mean
free path15. However, the different chemical potential in
the two valleys will also give rise to a finite anomalous
Hall response, which is given by

We find that the MHE transport coefficients differ from
the AHE transport coefficients by a factor of ∆U/µ.
Thus the MHE transport coefficients can be identified
in experiments by studying their variation with ∆U .
B. Surface states of a topological crystalline
insulator and monolayer WTe2
The electronic states of monolayer WTe2
33,49,50 or the
tilted surface states of a topological crystalline insula-
tor51,52 are both described by a similar low energy Hamil-
tonian. The anisotropic Hamiltonian is given by 27,30
H(k) =
(
Ak2 +Bk2 + δ −ikyvy +D
ikyvy +D Ak
2 −Bk2 − δ
)
. (23)
Equation (23) obeys TRS, i.e. T −1H(k)T = H(−k),
where T is the time reversal operator. The corresponding
energy dispersion is given by
�k = Ak
2 ±
√
(Bk2 + δ)2 + k2yv
2
y +D
2 . (24)
The +(−) sign denotes the conduction (valence) band.
The bands are shown in Fig. 2(a). We use the follow-
ing parameters: B = 1.0, vy = 1.0, D = 0.1, δ = −0.25,
all in eV. This Hamiltonian hosts two massive Dirac
cones of gap 2D along the kx direction at (Kx,Ky) =
(±
√
−δ/B, 0). The coefficient A tilts the dispersion
but it does not alter the band gap and the vy term
makes the dispersion anisotropic. The gap between the
bands at the Γ point, (kx, ky) = (0, 0), is 2µΓ, where
µΓ ≡ (δ2 + D2)1/2. Thus, the system with no tilt has a
single Fermi surface for |µ| > µΓ and two Fermi pockets
for |µ| < µΓ.
The BC of this system can be calculated analytically
and it is given by
Ω±z (k) = ±
kxvyBD[
(Bk2 + δ)2 + k2yv
2
y +D
2
]3/2 . (25)
Here, the +(−) sign stands for the conduction (valence)
band. The BC is independent of the tilt coefficient
A, and has opposite signs for the two bands. As ex-
pected from a time reversal symmetric system, it satisfies
Ωz(−k) = −Ωz(k). Furthermore, as Ωz ∝ kx, the two
valleys, centered around (Kx,Ky) = (±
√
−δ/B, 0), have
opposite BC as shown in Fig. 2(b). The Fermi surface
of the valence band is also shown for µ = −0.35 eV. The
green (black) coloured portion of the contours represent
vx > 0 (vx < 0). The BC is directly proportional to the
bandgap, Ωz ∝ D, which is typical of two-dimensional
gapped systems. The two gapped Dirac nodes are sepa-
rated in the momentum space by 2
√
−δ/B. In this con-
tinuum model, as B → 0, the two gapped Dirac nodes
move to ±∞. This reflects in the vanishing of the BC
with B → 0.
It turns out that even though this model is anisotropic,
it has a mirror symmetry which forces the semiclassical
velocity contribution to the Hall coefficients to vanish27.
Thus the Hall charge and energy current is determined
by the MHE. We calculate the MHC numerically using
Eq. (15), and analytically for the simpler case of A = 0,
in the regime of single Fermi surface in the valence band
(µ < −µΓ). Our analytical calculations yield

presented in Appendix B. In Fig. 3(a) we have shown
the µ dependence of the conductivity. The red dashed
line corresponds the analytical result given in Eq. (26)
and the blue solid line represents the numerical result
obtained from Eq. (15). The corresponding conductiivty
curve for µ > 0 (in the conduction band) will be the
mirror image of Fig. 3(a) owing to the particle-hole sym-
metry present in the system.
As the Fermi level moves below the top of the valence
band, starting from a lower value, the conductivity in-
creases, attains a peak and then decreases. The lower
value of the conductivity in the region above µΓ can be at-
tributed to the cancellation of contributions coming from
the distinct Fermi pockets as shown in Fig. 2(b). And the
decrease of the conductivity well inside the band can be
attributed to the smaller value of BC at such lower ener-
gies.
The Magnus Nernst conductivity defined in Eq. (16)
can now be obtained from the MHC by using the Mott
relation. A simple calculation yields

tivity is also applicable for the Nernst conductivity. However,
the contribution from the conduction and the valance band
will differ by a minus sign.

C. Bilayer graphene
Another interesting system to explore the Magnus Hall
transport is the bilayer graphene with trigonal warping53,54.
The valley resolved Hamiltonian with a gap is given by55
Hs(k) =
(
∆ svk−s − λk2s
svks − λk2−s −∆
)
. (31)
Here, k± = kx±iky with the subscript s denoting the valley
index, s = +1 for K valley and s = −1 for the K′ valley.
In bilayer graphene, or in Eq. (31), the gap ∆ is introduced
by a perpendicular electric field56, which we will treat as a
fixed parameter. Note that the K′ valley is the time reversed
partner of the K valley, i.e., Hs(k) = Hs̄(−k). The dispersion
of this Hamiltonian is given by

The BC for Hamiltonian (31) can be calculated analytically
and is given by
Ω
s,±
z (k) =
∓s∆(v2 − 4λ2k2)
2
[
∆2 + k2v2 + λ2k4 − 2svλkx(k2x − 3k2y)
]3/2 .
(33)
The ± sign stands for the conduction and valence band. As
usual for two dimension gapped systems, we find Ωz ∝ ∆,
the gap in the band dispersion. Unlike the case of gapped
graphene considered above, here the two valleys have different
BC as highlighted in Fig. 4(b) and (d). However, by virtue
of the two valleys being time reversed partners of each other,
we have Ωsz(−k) = Ωs̄z(k).
The Magnus Hall coefficients can now be calculated nu-
merically with the inclusion of the spin degree of freedom and
adding the contribution from the two valleys. Results ob-
tained from Eqs. (15)-(17) are presented in Fig. 5. We have
chosen the parameters of the Hamiltonian to be v = 0.66 eV
and λ = 115.7 eV and the gate induced potential energy dif-
ference to be ∆U = 10 meV. The MHCs are shown for two
different temperatures: for 150 K in orange line and for 15
K in green. Figure 5(a) shows that the MHC decreases af-
ter a sharp rise as we move the Fermi level below the top of
the valence band at 15 K27. However, the thermal broaden-
ing of the Fermi function causes σm to be non-zero even for
µ > −∆ (in the bandgap) at higher temperature. Figure 5(b)
shows the Magnus Nernst conductivity obtained by exact nu-
merical integration (solid lines) along with that obtained by
using the Mott relation (dashed lines). The reults based on
the exact and the Mott relation are in better agreement at
lower temperature. This is expected as the Mott relation is
valid only in the regime µ � kBT 38. In Fig. 5(c) we have
shown the Magnus thermal Hall conductivity obtained from
exact numerical integration (solid lines) along with the results
using the Wiedemann-Franz law (dashed lines). Note the de-
viation of the Wiedemann-Franz law based results from the
exact relation for 150 K, when µ is near the top of the valence
band.
V. DISCUSSIONS
The Magnus Hall responses will be dominant for systems
with TRS but broken inversion symmetry, as the AHE in such
systems vanishes. However, the Magnus Hall effects can also
be present in TRS broken and SIS invariant systems, along
with a finite anomalous Hall response. More importantly,
the presence of a finite BC is only a necessary condition for
generating a finite Magnus Hall response. In addition, an
asymmetry of the Fermi surface and BC is also needed, as
demonstrated by the examples of monolayer WTe2 and bilayer
graphene.
All the results in our paper are derived within some ap-
proximations, and they are valid only up to first order in the
variation of the in-built electric field (Ein or ∆U). For exam-
ple, while the effect of the in-built electric field is included in
the velocity, its effect on modification of the band-structure
and in creating an inhomogeneous distribution function of
carriers is not considered. Inclusion of such considerations
will lead to MHE, which depends on higher powers of ∆U ,
with our calculations representing the linear order response
in ∆U .
Strictly speaking, the Magnus Hall effects are non-linear
effect. The non-linearity is manifested via the product of the
in-built electric field and external bias. However, in terms of
the external bias field, it is linear response phenomena. More
importantly, since its origin lies in the Berry curvature, it
can also couple to the spin, valley and orbital degrees of free-
dom, giving rise to Magnus spin Hall, Magnus valley Hall, and
Magnus orbital Hall effects. More interestingly, the Magnus
velocity is unique in the sense that it need not be perpendic-
ular to the carrier velocity as in classical Hall effect or to the
applied bias field as in the anomalous Hall effect. This can be
used to design new devices, which have no analogue in terms
of the other Hall effects.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have explored the Magnus Hall transport
in inversion symmetry broken systems with a finite Berry cur-
vature. Physically, the origin of the magnus Hall effects lies
in the anomalous Magnus velocity arising in a self-rotating
quantum electronic wave-packet moving through a potential
energy gradient in a crystalline material.
Motivated by the recent demonstration of Magnus Hall ef-
fect in Ref. [27], we explicitly demonstrate the existence of a
Magnus Nernst effect, and Magnus thermal Hall effect for dif-
ferent systems. We calculate all the transport coefficients, and
show that the Magnus Hall transport coefficients satisfy the
Mott relation and Wiedemann-Franz law at low temperature.
Using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques,
we demonstrate the Magnus Hall effects in three concrete ex-
ample systems: gapped graphene, monolayer WTe2 and bi-
layer graphene. These new Hall effects will be fundamentally
useful for experimentally probing the Berry curvature and
can also be used for potential electrical and thermo-electric
devices.

Appendix A: Expressions of conductivities from
current
Here, we derive the expressions of transport coefficients
from current. Usually this step is very straightforward. How-
ever, since the Magnus Hall current is position dependent, we
have to perform a spatial average for obtaining the transport
coefficients.
The Hall component of the charge current in the diffusive
regime can be evaluated in the form jE(x) = j
0
E(x) + j

E(x).
The subscript denotes the current due to an external electric
field, while the superscript is indicative of the order of the
internal potential energy difference ∆U . Using Eq. (5) and
ignoring the anomalous Hall current we calculate the charge
current to be

spatial average using jE = (1/L)

To evaluate this, we use the identity δ[f(x)] =
∑

δ(x −

first derivative. This yields,
δ(�k − µ) =
∑

|µ|δ(θ − θµ)
|k2v2y sin θµ cos θµ|

Here, we have used the polar coordinates, for convenience,
with θ as the polar angle. The zeros are found to be

Recall that for |µ| > µΓ, we have a single Fermi surface.
Thus, we can identify the k-states which contribute to the
integration. For a given µ, the radial component, k, can vary
between kmin and kmax which are given by
k

Note that kmax is always greater than the radial distance of
the massive Dirac cone located at (Kx,Ky) = (±
√
−δ/B, 0).
However, kmin can be greater or lesser than the same depend-
ing on the chemical potential. Thus, it is useful to define
µ0 =
√
D2 − δv2y/B for which kmin = Kx =
√
−δ/B. We
have, kmin > Kx (kmin < Kx) for |µ| > µ0 (|µ| < µ0).
The other set of conditions on the integrations are imposed
by vx > 0. The expression of x-component of velocity is given
by
vx(k) =
2Bk(Bk2 + δ) cos θ
~�k
. (B8)
With B > 0, the positive velocity condition can be satisfied
for two scenarios: i) cos θ > 0 with k2 < −δ/B and ii) cos θ <
0 with k2 > −δ/B. In the first scenario we have to integrate
8
from k ∈ [kmin, k =
√
−δ/B] and for the second scenario, k ∈
[
√
−δ/B, kmax]. For a given µ, the first scenario in satisfied
by Eq. (B4) and the second scenario is satisfied by Eq. (B5).
The limits of the k-integral are summarized in the tabular
form in Table. I.
Using these conditions in Eq. (B2) we obtain,

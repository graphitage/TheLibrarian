A single photon source is a key enabling technology in device-independent quantum communication1,2,
quantum simulation for instance boson sampling3,4, linear optics-based5,6 and measurement-based quan-
tum computing7. These applications involve many photons and therefore place stringent requirements on the
efficiency of single photon creation. The scaling on efficiency is an exponential function of the number of
photons. Schemes taking full advantage of quantum superpositions also depend sensitively on the coherence
of the photons, i.e. their indistinguishability8. It is therefore crucial to maintain the coherence over long
strings of photons. Here, we report a single photon source with an especially high system efficiency: a photon
is created on-demand at the output of the final optical fibre with a probability of 57%. The coherence of
the photons is very high and is maintained over a stream consisting of thousands of photons; the repetition
rate is in the GHz regime. We break with the established semiconductor paradigms, such as micropillars9–14,
photonic crystal cavities15 and waveguides16–18. Instead, we employ gated quantum dots in an open, tunable
microcavity. The gating ensures low-noise operation; the tunability compensates for the lack of control in
quantum dot position and emission frequency; the output is very well-matched to a single-mode fibre. An
increase in efficiency over the state-of-the-art by more than a factor of two, as reported here, will result in an
enormous decrease in run-times, by a factor of 107 for 20 photons4.
A single emitter can be used as a single photon source.
Unlike a cold atom in vacuum19, an emitter in the solid-
state is naturally trapped in space20. Semiconductor
quantum dots have large optical dipole moments, very
high radiative efficiency and a relatively weak coupling to
phonons, advantages over other solid-state emitters21–23.
A single quantum dot under resonant excitation at low
temperature mimics a two-level system. Photonic en-
gineering on a nano- or micro-scale is required to fun-
nel the photons into one specific mode and to couple
the photons from this mode into a single-mode fibre24,25.
There are two established techniques. First, in a resonant
microcavity, photons are emitted preferentially into the
microcavity mode (the Purcell effect), and in an asym-
metric microcavity, photon leakage from the microcavity
acts as an out-coupler. Much success has been achieved
with micropillars9–14 (for which the β-factor, the proba-
bility of emission into the microcavity mode, is as high as
88%9) and with photonic crystal cavities15. Secondly, in
an on-chip waveguide, photons are emitted preferentially
into a laterally-propagating mode and a grating couples
the light off the chip16–18. In this case, a β-factor as
high as 98% has been demonstrated16. However, in both
schemes, the system efficiency, the efficiency as measured
in the final optical fibre, is limited by losses and inefficien-
cies in the out-coupling. The highest system efficiency
reported to date is 24%14.
Coherence depends sensitively on the noise in the de-
vice. Charge noise results in a fluctuating emission fre-

quency; it may also result in telegraph noise should the
charge state of the quantum dot itself fluctuate. Charge
noise is extremely low in gated, high-quality material26.
In particular, the charge state of the quantum dot can be
locked by Coulomb blockade27. This not only eliminates
telegraph noise associated with a fluctuating quantum
dot charge but also allows a single electron (or hole) to be
trapped on the quantum dot, facilitating a spin-photon
interface. In a “best of both worlds” device, photonic
engineering is combined with gated operation.
Here, we take the microcavity-route to generating sin-
gle photons from single quantum dots. We use an open
microcavity28–30. There are some compelling features:
the microcavity is tunable28; the output is very close to
a simple Gaussian mode; it is straightforward to incor-
porate gates29; scattering and absorption losses are ex-
tremely small29.
In the generic case (Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian
with atom-cavity coupling g, cavity loss-rate κ, atom de-
cay rate into non-cavity modes γ), β = FP/(FP + 1)
where the Purcell factor is FP = 4g
2/(κγ). The con-
version efficiency of an exciton in the quantum dot to
a photon exciting the cavity is η = β · κ/(κ + γ). For
fixed g and γ, η can be maximised31 by choosing κ = 2g.
Taking a quantum dot with transform-limited linewidth
(γ/(2π) = 0.29 GHz) in a microcavity (g/(2π) = 4.4
GHz)29, the condition κ = 2g implies an efficiency η as
high as 94%. In other words, ideal behaviour results in
high efficiency single photon generation. We present a
realisation of this concept.
We use a highly miniaturised Fabry-Perot cavity
(Fig. 1a). The “top” mirror has a concave shape and
is micro-machined into a silica substrate (Supplemen-

FIG. 1. (a) The microcavity. The semiconductor heterostructure consists of a GaAs/AlAs Bragg mirror, the “bottom” mirror,
and a p-i-n diode. The InGaAs quantum dots are located in the intrinsic region, in tunnel-contact with the Fermi sea in the
n-layer. The position of the heterostructure can be adjusted (↔, l) with respect to the “top” mirror, a concave mirror in a
silica substrate, using an XYZ-nanopositioner. A simulation (red points) shows that the output is very close to a Gaussian
beam (black line). (b) Calculated conversion efficiency, quantum dot exciton to photon exiting the top mirror, as a function

tary Information Sec. II); the “bottom” mirror is a
highly reflective planar mirror, part of the semicon-
ductor heterostructure28 (Supplementary Information
Sec. I). Quantum dots in this structure exhibit close-
to-transform-limited linewidths29. With a highly reflec-
tive top mirror, the microcavity has Q-factors up to 106
and the strong coupling regime of cavity-QED can be
reached29. This allows a precise measurement of the cou-
pling (g/(2π) = 4.0 GHz) and an estimation of the resid-
ual losses in the semiconductor (373 ppm per round-trip).
Here, we use a modest reflectivity top mirror (trans-
mission 10,300 ppm per round-trip according to the de-
sign) chosen such that κ ' κtop � κbottom and κ ≈ 2g
(Fig. 1b). The measuredQ-factor is 12,600, matching the
value expected from the design of the two mirrors (Sup-
plementary Information Sec. V). At these Q-factors, the
residual losses in the semiconductor are negligible. The
heterostructure contains thin n- and p-type layers with
the quantum dots in tunnel contact with the electron
Fermi sea in the n-type layer such that Coulomb block-
ade is established (Supplementary Information Sec. I). It
is straightforward to make contacts to the n- and p-type
layers even in the full microcavity structure. The chip
is positioned relative to the top mirror in situ (Fig. 1a):
this tunability is exploited to ensure a match between a
particular quantum dot and the microcavity mode, both
in frequency and lateral position.
A challenge in all optically-driven quantum dot sin-
gle photon sources is to separate the single photon out-
put from the driving laser light. A standard scheme is
to excite and detect in a cross-polarised configuration32.
Applied to a charged exciton for which the transitions
are circularly polarised, this scheme leads to a 50% loss
in the collection efficiency. Here, we avoid this loss.
We work with the positively-charged exciton, X+. The
microcavity mode splits into two modes, H- and V-

Via Lorentzian fits, the β-factor specific to the H-polarised mode is determined: βH = 86%. (c) Measured signal versus square
root of laser power for zero microcavity-X+ detuning. The laser repetition frequency is 76.3 MHz; the detector has an efficiency

the quantum dot to the driving field (Fig. 1c).
polarised, separated by 50 GHz, on account of a small
birefringence (Supplementary Information Sec. III); the
spectrum of the laser pulses is larger than this splitting
(Fig. 1c). The quantum dot is tuned into resonance with
the higher-frequency, H-polarised mode. The laser is V-
polarised and blue-detuned with respect to both micro-
cavity modes such that the tails of the laser spectrum
and the V-polarised microcavity mode overlap at the fre-
quency of the H-polarised mode (Fig. 1c). The quantum
dot emits preferentially into the H-polarised microcav-
ity mode. A cross-polarised scheme now separates the
V-polarised laser pulses from the H-polarised single pho-
tons with a loss depending only on the unwanted coupling
of the quantum dot to the V-polarised mode (Supple-
mentary Information Sec. VI). Provided that the mode-
splitting is larger than the mode linewidths14, this loss is
small.
Experimentally, we choose a quantum dot and max-
imise the coupling of the X+-resonance to the microcav-
ity. To do this, we record a decay curve following res-
onant excitation: the radiative decay rate is largest at
maximum coupling. The quantum dot and microcavity
frequencies are tuned to establish a resonance (Fig. 2a).
The Purcell-factor is determined by scanning the micro-
cavity frequency: on resonance with a microcavity mode,
the decay time is just 47.5 ps; far detuned, the decay
time tends to 520 ps, resulting in FP = 10 for QD1 (12
for QD6) (Fig. 2b). On resonance with the H-polarised
microcavity mode, we determine βH, the probability of
emission into the H-polarised mode, to be βH = 86%.
We now maximise the flux of single photons. Imple-
menting the excitation scheme (Fig. 1c), the central fre-
quency of the laser is tuned to find the maximum sig-
nal. As a function of laser power, the quantum dot sig-
nal exhibits oscillations, indicative of Rabi oscillations
(Fig. 2c). The laser power is set at the maximum signal
corresponding to the best implementation of a π-pulse.
An intensity autocorrelation measurement demonstrates
clear photon antibunching and a high purity of single
photon generation, g(2)(0) = 2.1% (Fig. 3a). The purity
4
is limited by a small amount of laser light leaking into
the detection channel (0.3% of total signal) and double-
excitation events.
The main new feature over previous experiments is the
very high efficiency of the source. On excitation with a
π-pulse, we obtain an on-demand, coherent single photon
at the output of the collection fibre (a standard optical
fibre) with a probability of 57%. The efficiency is deter-
mined from the photon flux. At a repetition frequency
of 76.3 MHz, we attenuate the beam by a factor of 9.9
(to avoid saturating the detector) and measure the count
rate (Fig. 2c). Taking account of the detector efficiency
and a small nonlinearity in the detector’s response (Sup-
plementary Information Sec. VII), we determine the sys-
tem efficiency, the probability of creating a single photon
at the output of the system’s final optical fibre, to be
53± 3% for QD1 (57± 3% for QD6).
The coherence of the single photons is probed with
two-photon interference, a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) ex-

periment. On creating two photons 1 ns apart in time,
the raw HOM visibility is Vraw = 91.6% (Fig. 3b). Cor-
recting for a small imperfection in the HOM interferom-
eter, Vraw = 92.5%. The HOM visibility is negatively
influenced by the finite g(2)(0): following the standard
procedure33, the “true” photon overlap can be estimated
to be V ' (1 + 2g(2)(0)) · Vraw = 96.7% (Supplemen-
tary Information Sec. IV). This demonstrates that suc-
cessively generated photons are highly coherent. Crucial
however is the coherence of photons separated much fur-
ther apart in time. The HOM visibility on interfering
two photons separated by 1.5 µs in time is equally high
(Fig. 3c). Given that photons can be created each nano-
second (Fig. 3b), these experiments demonstrate that
the device can produce a string consisting of thousands
of highly coherent photons. The coherence time of the
source is clearly much larger than 1.5 µs (Supplementary
Information Sec. IV).
The single-photon source is very stable in time. The
noise in the single photon flux is limited by shot-noise on
time-scales of one hour (Fig. 4a), increasing only slightly
on time-scales of multiple hours (Fig. 4b). The tunabil-
ity of the microcavity enables us to bring multiple quan-
tum dots one-by-one into resonance with the same mi-
crocavity mode. Six quantum dots were investigated in
detail. All six have essentially the same values of single
photon purity, system efficiency (Fig. 4c) and coherence
(Fig. 4d).
The system efficiency, Σ, here 53%–57% (QD1–QD6),
is a product of factors, Σ = π ·βH ·κtop/(γ+κtotal) ·ηoptics
where π is the probability of producing a photon on ex-
citation with a laser pulse; and ηoptics represents the
throughput of the entire optical system (from micro-
cavity to the output from the final output fibre). βH
and κtop/(γ + κtotal) are both determined precisely in
the experiment, 86% and 96%, respectively. βH matches
theoretical expectations based on the optical dipole mo-
ment and the microcavity geomertry (Supplementary In-
formation Sec. V). To determine π, we describe the ex-
citation scheme, a detuned laser pulse followed by ring-
down, and how it drives a two-level system, including an
intensity-dependent phonon-related dephasing process34
(Supplementary Information Sec. VIII). This calculation
describes the Rabi oscillations very successfully (Fig. 2c),
enabling us to infer that at the peak signal, π = 96.3%.
The remaining factor, ηoptics (68%), accounts for the
throughput losses in the optical components, losses on
coupling the single photons into the single-mode fibre,
and reflection losses at three surfaces (upper surface of
top mirror, two fibre facets) which lacked an antireflec-
tion coating. The conclusion of this analysis is that the
main contribution to the losses lies in ηoptics, i.e. in the
classical optics. The quantum effects, the coupling to
the vacuum mode of the microcavity and the scheme to
invert the two-level system via the off-resonance micro-
cavity mode, are under excellent control.
Based on this analysis, a single photon source with a
system efficiency of 80% is within reach by eliminating

the losses in the optical components. Even better
performance is conceivable by improving the quantum
effects – an increased coupling (via miniaturisation of
the top mirror), a decreased bare decay rate (via lateral
structuring), and a larger microcavity mode-splitting
will all increase the efficiency. In addition to the
applications as a single photon source, a further broad
area of application exploits the spin of the trapped hole.
Implementing spin manipulation in the microcavity
device, for instance via lateral excitation (an “atom”
drive), will facilitate applications such as a single photon
transistor35, the efficient and fast creation of spin-photon
entangled pairs, and an efficient source of multi-photon
cluster states36.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
I. HETEROSTRUCTURE DESIGN AND GROWTH
The heterostructure is grown by molecular beam epi-
taxy (MBE) and consists of an n-i-p diode with embedded
self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs). This design
allows for QD frequency tuning via the dc Stark effect as
well as QD charging via Coulomb blockade. The n-i-
p diode is grown on top of a semiconductor distributed
Bragg reflector (DBR), a planar “bottom” mirror, com-
posed of 46 pairs of AlAs (80.6 nm thick)/GaAs (67.9 nm
thick) quarter-wave layers (QWLs) with a centre wave-
length of nominally 940 nm (measured: 917 nm). Below
the DBR, an AlAs/GaAs short-period superlattice (SPS)
composed of 18 periods of 2.0 nm AlAs and 2.0 nm GaAs
is grown for stress-relief and surface-smoothing.
From bottom to top (see Supplementary Fig. 1a), the
diode consists of an n-contact, 41.0 nm Si-doped GaAs,
n+, doping concentration 2 · 1018 cm−3. A 25.0 nm layer
of undoped GaAs acts as a tunnel barrier between the
n-contact and the QDs. The self-assembled InGaAs QDs
are grown by the Stranski-Krastanov process and the QD
emission is blue-shifted via a flushing-step37. The QDs
are capped by an 8.0 nm layer of GaAs. A blocking bar-
rier, 190.4 nm of Al.33Ga.67As, reduces current flowing
across the diode in forward-bias. The p-contact consists
of 5.0 nm of C-doped GaAs, p+ (doping concentration
2 · 1018 cm−3) followed by 20.0 nm of p++-GaAs (doping
concentration 1 · 1019 cm−3). Finally, there is a 54.6 nm-
thick GaAs capping layer.
The layer thicknesses are chosen to position the QDs at
an antinode of the vacuum electric field. The p-contact
is centred around a node of the vacuum electric field to
minimise free-carrier absorption in the p-doped GaAs.
Coulomb blockade is established on times comparable to
the radiative decay time for GaAs tunnel barriers typi-
cally <∼ 40 nm thick. This is less than the thickness of a
QWL thereby preventing the n-contact being positioned
likewise at a node of the vacuum electric field. How-
ever, at a photon energy 200 meV below the bandgap38,
the free-carrier absorption of n+-GaAs (α ≈ 10 cm−1) is
almost an order-of-magnitude smaller than that of p++-
GaAs (α ≈ 70 cm−1). The weak free-carrier absorption of
n+-GaAs is exploited in the design presented here by us-
ing a standard 25 nm thick tunnel barrier. The n-contact
is positioned close to a vacuum field node, although not
centred around the node itself.
After growth, individual 3.0 × 2.5 mm2 pieces are
cleaved from the wafer. The QD density increases from
zero to ∼ 1010 cm−2 in a roughly centimetre-wide stripe
across the wafer. The sample used in the experiments
presented here was taken from this stripe. Its QD den-
sity, measured by photoluminescence imaging, is approx-
imately 7× 106 cm−2.
Separate ohmic contacts are made to the p++ and n+
layers. For the n-contact, the capping layer, the p-doped
layers and part of the blocking barrier are removed by
a local etch in citric acid. On the new surface, NiAuGe
is deposited by electron-beam physical vapour deposi-
tion (EBPVD). Low-resistance contacts form on thermal
annealing. To contact the p-doped layer, the capping
layer is removed by another local etch. On the new sur-
face, a Ti/Au contact pad (100 nm thick) is deposited
by EBPVD. Although this contact is not thermally an-
nealed, it provides a reasonably low-resistance contact to
the top-gate on account of the very high p-doping (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1a).
After fabricating the contacts to the n- and p-layers,
the contacts are covered with photoresist and a passiva-
tion layer is deposited onto the sample surface. A thin
native oxide layer on the surface is removed by etching a
few nm of GaAs in HCl. Following a rinse in deionised
water, the sample is immersed in a bath of ammonium
sulphide ((NH4)2S). Subsequently, the sample is trans-
ferred rapidly into the chamber of an atomic-layer de-
position (ALD) setup. An 8 nm layer of Al2O3 is de-
posited using ALD at a temperature of 150◦C. With the
present heterostructure, this process is essential to re-
duce surface-related absorption: a low-loss microcavity
is only achieved following surface-passivation29. An ad-
vantage of the surface passivation lies in the fact that it
prevents the native oxide of GaAs from re-forming after
its removal: it provides a stable termination to the GaAs
heterostructure39. Following the surface-passivation pro-
cedure and photoresist stripping, the NiAuGe and Ti/Au
films are wire-bonded to large Au pads on a sample
holder. Using silver paint, macroscopic wires (twisted
pairs) are connected to the Au pads.
When applying a voltage across the gates of this n-type
device, the neutral exciton, X0, is observed at intermedi-
ate biases. The negatively-charged trion, X−, is observed
at more positive bias, and the positively-charged trion,
X+ at more negative voltages. This particular device
presents a small leakage current at the X− voltage, mak-
ing it more appropriate to work with X+ instead. Given
a source of holes, n-type devices exhibit Coulomb block-
ade of positively-charged excitons40. The X0 and X+ can
both be excited by the same laser pulse. The splitting
between X0 and X+ varies from QD to QD in a range
between 606 GHz (QD1) to 143 GHz (QD3). At lower
voltages, the QD is initially empty. On exciting an X0
the electron tunnels out rapidly leaving a single hole, al-
lowing the X+ transition. Should the QD lose its residual
hole for any reason, the process repeats very rapidly.
II. CURVED MIRROR FABRICATION
The top mirror is fabricated in a 0.5 mm thick fused-
silica substrate. An atomically-smooth crater is ma-
chined at the silica surface via CO2-laser ablation
41,42.
We achieve craters with a similar radius of curvature as
described in Ref.42, but with a shallower profile by sub-
stituting the focusing lens in the ablation setup by a lens
with NA = 0.67.

The profile of the fabricated crater is measured by
a confocal laser scanning microscope (Keyence Corpo-
ration), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a. From the
two-dimensional height profile, two principal axes can be
identified, and the profile parameters can be extracted
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). The radius of curvature of
this crater is R = (11.98 ± 0.02)µm and the sagittal
height s = (0.41 ± 0.02)µm. After laser ablation, the
crater is coated with 8 QWL-pairs of Ta2O5 (refractive
index n = 2.09 at λ0 = 920 nm) and SiO2 (n = 1.48
at λ0 = 920 nm) layers (terminating with a layer of
Ta2O5) by ion-beam sputtering at a commercial com-
pany (Laseroptik GmbH), see Supplementary Fig. 1b.
III. MICROCAVITY CHARACTERISATION
The microcavity is a highly miniaturised Fabry-Perot
type resonator. A fundamental mode is resonant for a
given laser frequency at a particular microcavity length.
In order to determine the Q-factor of the microcavity, a
dark-field measurement is performed, as shown in Sup-
plementary Fig. 3. Given the spectral tunability of the
microcavity, its Q-factor can be determined for a wide
wavelength range within the stopband of the mirrors,
centred around λ0 = 919 nm.
Supplementary Fig. 3 shows such a measurement per-
formed on a fundamental mode at λ0 = 922 nm. The fun-
damental mode splits into two modes, each linearly po-
larised, with opposite polarisations, H and V. The mode-
splitting is 34.6 GHz in Supplementary Fig. 3. The H and
V axes align with the crystal axes of the semiconductor
wafer. This points to the physical origin of the mode-
splitting: a small birefringence in the semiconductor.
The birefringence is probably induced by a very small
uniaxial strain. The splitting of the fundamental micro-
cavity mode into two separate modes together with the
linear, orthogonal polarisations of these two modes are
exploited in the experiment to achieve high efficiencies
in our experiment, as discussed in Sec. VIII. The mode-
splitting is, therefore, an important parameter. Perform-
ing this measurement at different locations on the sample
yields similar values of Q-factor but a spread in mode-
splittings. For the quantum dots investigated, QD1 to
QD6, the splitting lies between 34.6 (QD6) and 50 GHz
(QD1).
The Q-factors of both H- and V-polarised modes are
extracted from the dark-field spectrum (green and blue
curves in Supplementary Fig. 3) yielding QH = 11, 900
and QV = 12, 800. The finesse is F = 506 ± 13. F was
determined by microcavity scanning at a wavelength of
922 nm, the same wavelength used for the determination
of theQ-factors. Unlike the mode-splitting, theQ-factors
are the same at different locations on the sample.
The microcavity does not have a monolithic design and
is potentially susceptible to environmental noise, vibra-

tions and acoustic noise. The microcavity is operated in
a helium bath-cryostat. The cryostat is shielded from
vibrational noise by an active damping stage and from
air-borne acoustic noise by an acoustic enclosure. Using
the microcavity itself as a noise sensor shows that envi-
ronmental noise is significant only when operating with
a finesse above 10, 00042, corresponding to a Q-factor of
approximately 105 with the present design. Here, the Q-
factor is approximately 104 and the experiment was not
troubled by residual environmental noise.
IV. COHERENCE OF THE SINGLE PHOTONS
We outline the procedure to extract the visibility of
the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference and present
the visibility of the HOM interference as a function of
the delay between single photons from the same source.
The HOM interference between subsequent photons is
measured by launching the stream of single photons into
a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a variable arm. The
variable arm introduces a time delay between the photons
that interfere. Supplementary Fig. 4a shows the optical
setup for the HOM measurements. The combination of
a half-wave plate and a polarising beam splitter (PBS)
is used to realise a variable beam-splitter. Three fibre-
based wave-retarders are utilised to match the polarisa-
tion of the light at the inputs of the fibre beam-splitter,
and hence to maximise the classical visibility of the in-
terferometer (1−�). In order to quantify the interference
between the two photons, the time delay between the
“clicks” on the two detectors D1 and D2 is measured in
the case when the classical visibility of the interferome-
ter is maximised (HOM‖). The red data-points in Fig. 3b
and 3c of the main text correspond to HOM‖ measure-
ments. A second half-wave plate can be inserted into the
beam path to make the photons from the two arms dis-

with linear polarisation, one H-polarised, the other V-polarised.
The H- and V-axes correspond to the crystal axes of the GaAs
wafer. The transmission data (red dots) are fitted to a double-
Lorentzian function (blue and green curves) yielding Q-factors for
the two polarised modes: QH = 11, 900 and QV = 12, 800. The

Imperfections in the HOM setup as well as the finite
value of g(2)(0) influence the measured Vraw. These im-
perfections can be accounted for in order to determine
the true overlap V of two single photon states produced
by the source. If P2 is the probability of creating two
photons with one laser pulse, P1 the probability of creat-
ing a single photon and P0 the probability of creating the
vacuum state, then V can be calculated from Vraw under
the assumptions that P2 � P1 � P0 and that the two
photons in the two-photon pulse are distinguishable33. In
principle, further corrections arise in the case P2 � P1
but P1 ≥ P0, as achieved at the output fibre of the
experiment. (An additional HOM signal arises when a
two-photon and a single-photon pulse are created succes-
sively.) In practice however, the HOM setup has a low
throughput and hence the assumption P2 � P1 � P0 is
reasonably fulfilled in the HOM measurements.The result

We characterised the optical setup and extracted R =

correction due to the imbalance in the beam-splitter is
negligible as the splitting ratio is close to 0.5:0.5 such
that the main contributions to the correction arise from
the limited visibility of the interferometer and the small
but finite g(2)(0) of the source.
Supplementary Fig. 4b shows the raw and the cor-
rected HOM visibilities as a function of the delay in the
interferometer. The error bars on Vraw represent the er-
rors arising from the shot noise of the detector. The
error bars on V include in addition uncertainties in the
exact visibility of the interferometer and uncertainties in
g(2)(0). Within error, V is insensitive to the time de-
lay between the interfering photons, indicating that the
coherence time of the source is significantly longer than
1.5 µs.
V. NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE MICROCAVITY
A. Calculation of the Q-factor
The microcavity Q-factor was calculated using a one-
dimensional transfer matrix simulation (The Essential
Macleod, Thin Film Center Inc.). The top mirror is de-
scribed using the design parameters taking the manu-
facturer’s values for the refractive index (mirror design:
silica-(HL)7H with H (L) a quarter-wave layer in the
high- (low-) index material at wavelength 920 nm, refrac-
tive indices 2.09 (1.48)). The transmission loss per round
trip of the top mirror is 10,300 ppm. The bottom mirror
has a nominal design GaAs-(HL)46-active layer with H
(L) a quarter-wave layer in GaAs (AlAs) at wavelength
940 nm, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a. In prac-
tice, the layers become gradually thinner during growth.
The wavelength of the stopband and the oscillations in
reflectivity out with the stopband can be very well de-
scribed by postulating a linear change in thickness dur-

ing growth29. The losses in the entire semiconductor het-
erostructure (including the free-carrier absorption in ac-
tive layer) can be assessed by measuring the Q-factors
with an extremely reflective, extremely low-loss top mir-
ror: the transmission loss is just 1 ppm per round trip;
the absorption/scattering losses amount to 373 ppm per
round-trip29. These losses are negligible compared to
the transmission loss of the top mirror. The simulated
Q-factor for the semiconductor DBR – GaAs active layer
(6 QWLs) – air-gap (4 QWLs) – top mirror structure is
about 14,000. This is very close to the measured value,
12,600, taking here an average over the positions of the 6
QDs evaluated in this work, and averaging over the two
microcavity modes.
Another possible source of losses in a microcavity is
diffraction losses at the DBR mirrors, also termed “side-
losses” in the micropillar community43,44. For tightly
confined modes, the angular spread in k-space expands,
increasing the losses in the DBR mirrors and reducing the
Q-factor. We carried out numerical simulations to probe
the effect of the radius of the curvature on the Q-factor.
Supplementary Fig. 5a shows the Q-factor as a function
of the wavelength and R. Supplementary Fig. 5b shows
a cut-through of the data at the centre of the stopband
(920 nm). As expected, for small radii the Q-factor is a
strong function of R and drops to 4,600 at R = 2.3µm.
At large radii (R > 6µm), the Q-factor is a weak func-
tion of R, and saturates at a value of 15,200. We use a
top mirror with R = 11.98µm in our experiments. We
calculate a Q-factor of 15,000 for this R at the centre
of the stopband, very close to the value at large radii.
Hence, we conclude that side losses are negligible in our
experiment. The Q-factor calculated with the exact top
mirror used in the experiment reduces to 14,000 due to
slightly reduced reflectivity achieved during coating rel-
ative to the designed structure.
B. Calculation of the QD-microcavity coupling
In order to estimate the QD-microcavity coupling, a
finite-elements method (Wave-Optics Module of COM-
SOL Multiphysics) is used to compute the vacuum elec-
tric field amplitude |Evac(r, z)| confined by the micro-
cavity (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The model assumes ax-
ial symmetry about the optical axis ((x, y) = 0). We
use a 1µm thick perfectly index-matched layer at all
outer boundaries of the simulation to prevent internal
reflections. The model takes a top mirror with radius
of curvature R = 11.98µm and sagittal height s =
0.41µm, exactly the mirror used in the experiments (see
Sec. II). This model also allows the Q-factor to be de-
termined, yielding Q = 14, 000, in agreement with the
one-dimensional transfer matrix calculation. Q = 14, 000
corresponds to κ/(2π) = 23.3 GHz where κ is the de-
cay rate of the microcavity. At the location of the QDs
(z = zQD) in the exact anti-node of the microcavity mode
(r = 0), the field is |Evac(0, zQD)| = 35, 000 V/m. A QD
at these wavelengths (920 nm) has an optical dipole of
µ/e = 0.71 nm where e is the elementary charge45. The
X+ consists of two degenerate circularly-polarised dipole
transitions (at zero magnetic field). We consider the in-
teraction of one of these circularly-polarised dipoles with
a linearly-polarised microcavity mode. The predicted
QD-cavity coupling is therefore h̄g = µ ·Evac(0, zQD)/
√
2
giving g/(2π) = 4.24 GHz. This dipole moment implies
a natural radiative decay rate of 1.72 ns−1, equivalently
γ/(2π) = 0.27 GHz (assuming the dipole approximation
in an unstructured medium). The calculated Purcell fac-
tor is therefore FP = 4g
2/(κγ) = 11.4.
The Purcell factor and coupling g can be determined
from the experiment. We focus on QD1. The natural
radiative decay γ rate can be determined by gradually
tuning the microcavity out of resonance with the QD,
extrapolating the decay rate to large detunings (main
text, Fig. 2b). This gives γ/(2π) = 0.30 GHz. This
11
agrees well with the estimate above. On resonance, the
total decay rate increases to 3.33 GHz. In the exper-
iment however, the polarisation-degeneracy of the mi-
crocavity is lifted (see Sec. III) and the QD exciton, an
X+, interacts with both microcavity modes. We focus
on the resonance with the H-polarised mode. We deter-
mine the contribution to the total decay rate from the
presence of the V-polarised microcavity mode by fitting
the total decay rate as a function of microcavity detun-
ing to two Lorentzians (main text, Fig. 2b). We sub-
tract the contribution from the V-polarised mode and the
free-space modes at the resonance with the H-polarised
mode, giving a decay rate of γH/(2π) = 2.87 GHz. This
is the decay rate contribution we would expect if the V-
polarised mode were highly detuned, in other words if
the microcavity mode-splitting were very large. At this
limit, a circularly-polarised dipole interacting with a sin-
gle linearly-polarised microcavity mode, allows a compar-
ison to be made with the calculated properties of the mi-
crocavity. The Purcell factor arising from the H-polarised
mode alone is therefore FHP = γH/γ = 9.6, close to the
calculated value (11.4). Using FHP = 4g
2/(γκ) and tak-
ing κ/(2π) = 24.00 GHz, the experimental value for the
H-polarised mode (wavelength 919 nm, Q = 13, 600), we
determine g/(2π) = 4.16 GHz. This is close to the calcu-
lated value (4.24 GHz). (Exact agreement is not expected
as the QD dipole fluctuates from QD to QD.) We can con-
clude that, first, the vacuum field in the real microcavity
is compatible with the value calculated from the micro-
cavity’s geometry; and second, that the lateral tuning of
the microcavity enables the QD to be positioned at the
anti-node of the vacuum field.
C. Properties of the output mode
A simulation of the microcavity mode was used to de-
termine the parameters of the output beam of the micro-
cavity, notably the beam waist. The calculated beam in
the SiO2 substrate, i.e. in the region above the top mirror
(Supplementary Fig. 1c), is fitted to a Gaussian beam46

0/λ0 is the Rayleigh range in the medium
(refractive index n = 1.4761 is taken for SiO2). The
fit taking w0 (and |E0|) as fit parameters results in
w0 = 1.05µm. This corresponds to a numerical aper-
ture of NA = λ0/(πw0) = 0.279.
VI. OPTICAL SETUP
In the experiment, the microcavity and one lens, the
objective lens, are mounted in a helium bath-cryostat
(T = 4.2 K). A window enables free optical-beams to
propagate from an optical setup at room temperature to
the microcavity system at low temperature28,29,42,47, as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. The top-mirror of the
microcavity is fixed at the top of a titanium “cage”, in-
side which the sample, mounted on a piezo-driven XYZ
nano-positioner, is placed28,29,42,47. The nano-positioner
allows for full in situ spatial (XY) and spectral (Z) tun-
ing of the microcavity. The titanium cage sits on another
XYZ nano-positioner, which allows for positioning of the
microcavity relative to the objective lens, an aspheric lens
of focal length fobj = 4.51 mm (355230-B, NA = 0.55,
Thorlabs Inc.), leading to close-to-perfect mode match-
ing of the microcavity and the microscope. The micro-
scope has a polarisation-based dark-field capability32. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, laser light is input into
the microscope via a single-mode fibre. The beam is
collimated by a ffibre = 11 mm aspheric lens (60FC-4-
A11-02, Schäfter + Kirchhoff GmbH). A linear polariser
(LP) guarantees the polarisation-matching of the input
beam to a polarising beam-splitter (PBS) which reflects
the light towards the microcavity. A half-wave plate al-
lows the axis of the polarisation to be rotated: the out-
put state is chosen to match one of the principal axes of
the microcavity, the V-axis. The light is then coupled
into the microcavity by the objective lens. The same
lens collects the microcavity output. H-polarised light is
transmitted by the PBS and focussed by a lens (60FC-4-
A11-02, Schäfter + Kirchhoff GmbH) into a single-mode
optical fibre (780HP fiber, Thorlabs Inc). In the dark-
field scheme, the suppression of V-polarised laser light is
optimised by adjusting an additional quarter-wave plate
in the main beam-path. Confocal detection is crucial.
For pulsed excitation, an extinction ratio up to 106 is
achieved (for continuous wave excitation, it is up to 108)
and remains stable over many days of measurement32.
The estimation of the microcavity beam waist
(Sec. V C) was used to optimise the fibre-coupling effi-
ciency by selecting an appropriate aspheric lens in front
of the optical fibre. The objective lens (355230-B, NA =
0.55, Thorlabs Inc.) has a focal length fobj = 4.51 mm.
Its NA is considerably larger than the NA of the mi-
crocavity in order to minimise clipping losses. The lens
coupling the output into the final optical fibre should be
chosen to ensure mode-matching with the single-mode
in the fibre. The fibre has a nominal mode-field ra-
dius of w1 = (2.71 ± 0.27)µm at λ0 = 920 nm (780HP
fiber, Thorlabs Inc.). The focal length for optimum fibre-
coupling is ffibre = fobj ·w1/w0 = (11.6±1.2) mm. Thus,
an ffibre = 11 mm aspheric lens was chosen for the exper-
iments.
The mode-locked laser (Mira 900-D picosecond mode,
Coherent GmbH) operates at a repetition rate of
76.3 MHz. The spectral width lies in the range between

the microcavity; the rest of the microscope is located outside the
cryostat. Laser light enters via a single-mode optical fibre and
is collimated with an f = 11 mm lens, passing through a linear-
polariser (LP). The input is reflected by a polarising beam-splitter
(PBS); the polarisation axis of the excitation, the V-axis, is set
by the half-wave plate (λ/2). The PBS and a quarter-wave plate

VII. CALIBRATION OF DETECTORS
Two photon-counting detectors were used to perform
experiments in this work, a superconducting NbTiN-
nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) unit (EOS 210
CS Closed-cycle, Single Quantum B.V.) optimised for
operation at 950 nm; and a near-infrared optimised,
fibre-coupled silicon avalanche photodiode (APD, model
SPCM-NIR, Excelitas Technologies GmbH & Co. KG).
In order to determine the efficiency of single-photon cre-
ation in this work, a careful calibration of the detectors’
efficiencies was performed.
The measurement relies on a setup with a free-space
laser beam (out-coupled from an optical fibre with angled
facet), a set of calibrated neutral density filters (NDs)
that can be placed in and out of the beam path, and
a second optical fibre into which the beam is coupled
(in-coupling via an angled facet). The frequency ν of
the laser light is determined precisely prior to measure-
ment with a interferometric device (HighFinesse Laser
and Electronic Systems GmbH). For optical power P ,
the photon flux is P
hν
where h is Planck’s constant.
With the NDs removed from the beam’s path, the
optical power emerging out of the second fibre is mea-
sured with a calibrated silicon photodiode (Sensor Model
S130C, Power measuring console PM100D, Thorlabs
Inc.). The attenuating NDs are subsequently placed into
the beam’s path in order to avoid saturating the photon-
counting detectors. The photon rate out of the fibre is
then measured using both the SNSPD and the APD. The
efficiency of each detector is given by the ratio of the mea-
sured count-rate to the known photon flux.
The efficiency of the SNSPD is determined to be
ηSNSPD =(82±5)%. This value matches closely the spec-
ifications provided by the manufacturer at a wavelength
of 940 nm. The efficiency of the APD is ηAPD =(42±3)%
with an angled facet directly in front of the detector
(FC-APC type fibre). The efficiency is slightly higher,
ηAPD =(44±3)%, with a flat facet directly in front of
the detector (FC-PC type fibre). The errors in the mea-
surements arise from 4% in the calibration of the NDs,
1.5% in the calibration of the NDs, 3% nominal error of
the silicon photodiode, and shot noise in the detectors
(1.0%).
We note that for the APD, due to the dead-time of
the detector (typically ∼ 20 ns), a linearity correction
factor must be applied to count rates above 200 kHz. This
correction factor scales quadratically from 1 at 200 kHz
to 3.32 at 25 MHz. For the experiments performed in
this work, the appropriate correction factor was applied
to take this effect into account. It results in a change in
efficiency of a few % at the count rates in Fig. 2c (main
paper).
VIII. THEORY: FILTERED PULSE EXCITATION
MECHANISM
This section outlines the excitation mechanism and de-
scribes the theoretical model that is used to describe the
experimental results. The Hamiltonian of a two-level sys-
tem (TLS) interacting with a drive field and a resonant
cavity mode, the H-polarised mode is given by:
Ĥ =
h̄ω0

σ̂z +
h̄

Ω−(t)σ̂+ + Ω
+(t)σ̂−
)
+
h̄g
(
â
†
H σ̂− + âH σ̂+
)
, (5)
where h̄ω0 is the energy difference between the excited
state and the ground state of the TLS, g is the coupling
constant between the cavity and the TLS, Ω±(t) are the
positive and negative frequency components of the driv-
ing field, and âH is the annihilation operator for the H-
polarised cavity mode.
In this work, the TLS is resonant with the H-polarised
cavity mode but the optical pulses enter the cavity via the
red-detuned V-polarised cavity mode. The optical pulse
(frequency ωL) is blue-detuned (by frequency ∆L) with
respect to the H-polarised cavity mode, ∆L = ωL − ω0.
(The scheme is shown in Fig. 1c of the main paper.) As

dt as a function of the laser detuning, ∆L, and the excitation power. For this simulation,
κ/(2π) = 25 GHz and A =32 fs/K. The detuning between the excitation cavity and the TLS is 50 GHz, as indicated by the green dashed
line on the colour plot. (b) Photon emission probability as a function of power: the theory (black line) along with scaled experimental

such, the TLS is driven not by the bare optical pulse but
by the pulse modified by the off-resonant V-polarised cav-
ity mode. Ω±(t) can be calculated by convoluting the op-
tical pulse with the impulse response function of a cavity,
i.e. e(−κt/2)cos(ωct), retaining the positive (negative) fre-
quency components. (ωc is the angular-frequency of the
cavity, here that of the V-polarised cavity mode.) We
introduce leakage out of the cavity mode with the Lind-
blad operator L̂ =
√
κ âH, where κ is the decay rate of
the cavity mode. Phonon-induced dephasing is modeled
with L̂ =
√
AT/2 |Ω(t)| σ̂z, where T is the temperature
of the phonon bath, and A is the parameter describing
the interaction between the phonons and the exciton48.
Finally, the photon emission probability is calculated as∫

We use the Python package Qutip49,50 to set up and
solve the equations of motion based on the Hamiltonian
in Eq. 5. Supplementary Fig. 7a shows the photon emis-
sion probability as a function of the laser frequency and
excitation power. In these simulations, the excitation
cavity is −50 GHz away from the TLS resonance corre-
sponding to the mode-splitting of our cavity (QD1), and
the pulse width is tp = 5.2 ps (defined as the full-width-at-
half-maximum of the laser intensity). The photon emis-
sion probability shows Rabi-like oscillations as expected
from a driven TLS. However, as evident from the plot,
the full inversion of the TLS takes place when the exci-
tation laser is blue-detuned from the TLS resonance con-
trary to the textbook case where maximum inversion is
obtained under strict resonance conditions. The crucial
point is that the incomplete Rabi oscillations do not sig-
nify an incomplete inversion of the TLS. On the contrary,
by choosing the optimal detuning of the laser pulse, the
photon emission probability reaches values close to one,
Supplementary Fig. 7b.
We model the experimental results with the follow-
ing parameter set: ∆L/(2π) = 32 GHz, tp = 5.2 ps,
and A = 32 fs/K. These parameters match well with
the expected pulse-width based on the measured spec-
tral width and the detuning ∆L/(2π) = 32 GHz found
in the experiment. There is a mismatch between the
phonon-induced dephasing rate and the value reported in
Ref.48. However, such a discrepancy is not uncommon in
the literature48,51,52, and could hint at other excitation-
induced dephasing mechanisms. With these parameters,
the model shows that a near complete inversion of the
TLS is possible. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7b,
the calculated photon emission probability is 96.3% at
the first Rabi peak. Excitation-induced dephasing is im-
portant to describe the subsequent Rabi peak but results
in only a small decrease at the first Rabi peak.

Abstract: The presence of a massless spin-2 field in an effective field theory results in a t-channel
pole in the scattering amplitudes that precludes the application of standard positivity bounds. Despite
this, recent arguments based on compactification to three dimensions have suggested that positivity
bounds may be applied to the t-channel pole subtracted amplitude. If correct this would have deep
implications for UV physics and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Within the context of a simple renor-
malizable field theory coupled to gravity we find that applying these arguments would constrain the
low-energy coupling constants in a way which is incompatible with their actual values. This contra-
diction persists on deforming the theory. Further enforcing the t-channel pole subtracted positivity
bounds on such generic renormalizable effective theories coupled to gravity would imply new physics
at a scale parametrically smaller than expected, with far reaching implications. This suggests that
generically the positivity bounds are inapplicable with gravity and we highlight a number of issues
with the compactification arguments.

1 Introduction
Over the past few decades effective field theories (EFTs) have proven to be an incredibly powerful tool
for studying physical systems at both high and low energies, with applications in all areas of physics
ranging from particle physics to cosmology and condensed matter. While it is almost always possible
to come up with an EFT valid in a given energy range that correctly describes the physical problem
in question, a theoretically more compelling question is whether a given low-energy EFT can be suc-
cessfully UV completed into another theory valid at higher energies. The answer depends strongly on
what requirements one wishes to impose on the high energy theory. Requiring that the low-energy
EFT has a standard UV completion that is Lorentz invariant, local and causal is known to impose
strong constraints on the coefficients in the low-energy action [1–3]. These are known as the positivity
bounds and can be imposed on the scattering amplitudes in the low-energy theory by using the axioms
of the S-matrix theory, mostly relying on its analyticity properties. First developed for scalar field
theories in the forward limit, the positivity bounds have been since generalized to particles with spin
[4–12] and extended away from the forward limit [13]. Including any additional known information
about the low-energy EFT (e.g. calculable low-energy loop diagrams) has enabled to further expand
the applications of the positivity bounds, going under the name of improved positivity bounds [7, 8, 14].
From the point of view of practical applications of positivity bounds to real world EFTs, one
of the assumptions that turns out to be the most restrictive is that of polynomial boundedness of
the scattering amplitudes in the complex s-plane, inferred from locality. The famous Froissart bound
[15, 16], extended beyond the forward limit in [17], states that in the presence of a mass gap, any
local 2 − 2 scattering amplitude should not grow faster than the fourth power of the center of mass
energy at sufficiently high energy. Technically speaking, the requirement of the existence of a mass gap
makes the positivity bounds not directly applicable to one of the most intriguing low-energy effective
theories — general relativity (GR). Nevertheless, it is typically expected, even with gravity, that the
scattering amplitude will be bounded at least in the Jin-Martin [17] sense lim|s|→∞ s
−2A(s, t) = 0 at
fixed t, as is argued to be the case in string theory for fixed momentum transfer scattering [18], despite
the violation of polynomial boundedness. This justifies attempting to apply the positivity bounds to
gravitational EFTs [19, 20].
A more serious issue associated with applying positivity bounds to gravitational theories, is the
presence of an infamous t–channel pole whose residue grows faster than the Froissart or Jin-Martin
– 1 –
bound. This growth implies that the pole cannot be subtracted, or else the resulting subtracted am-
plitude would itself violate the Froissart bound. More precisely, this would contradict the assumption
that we can write a dispersion relation for the pole subtracted scattering amplitude with only two
subtractions. More importantly though, the pole at t = 0, and the associated branch point that arises
from graviton loops, prevents the analytic continuation of the partial wave expansion from the physical
region t < 0 to t ≥ 0 which is a crucial step in deriving positivity bounds. As a result it is impossible
to use the positivity bounds in their standard form for processes that exhibit a spin-J pole with J ≥ 2.
Recently, a novel way to deal with this t-channel pole was suggested in [21], which relies on com-
pactifying one of the spatial dimensions on a circle. Since there is no propagating massless graviton in
three dimensions (3d) one would expect the unpleasant massless spin-2 t-channel pole1 to be absent
from the scattering amplitude. While in fact the term is still present perturbatively in the ampli-
tude written in Mandelstam variables, there is indeed no physical massless graviton mediating the
exchange. Furthermore, in Mandelstam variables the problematic part of the residue is removed after
resumming the contributions from higher order ladder diagrams (see, e.g. [22] and appendix A of
[21]). Motivated by this observation, one can then argue that the standard positivity bound should
apply to 3d scattering amplitudes. This technique would then allow us to constrain coefficients in
the low-energy EFTs which were previously beyond the reach of the positivity bounds programme in
four spacetime dimensions (4d). Interestingly, from the 4d point of view these bounds are equivalent
to what one would have deduced, would the t-channel pole be simply disregarded. If applicable, this
would be a remarkable result with far–reaching implications. It could potentially open a whole new
window on investigating the higher derivative corrections in either GR itself or in any theory that
includes massless spin-2 or higher fields. We will refer to these as ‘compactified positivity bounds’.
In [21] the implications of these compactified positivity bounds on the higher derivative correc-
tions to the Einstein–Maxwell theory were studied in relation to the weak gravity conjecture (WGC)
[23]. It was found that the positivity bounds imply that extremal black holes of mass M and charge
Q must satisfy MPlQ/M > 1, exceeding the extremal charge-to-mass ratio in GR and thus proving
one of the versions of the weak gravity conjecture as suggested in [24, 25]. Another remarkable ex-
ample of possible consequences of these positivity bounds was studied in [26] where the impact of the
backreaction of matter fields on the propagation speed of the graviton was studied. It was found that
imposing the compactified positivity bounds on the couplings of the higher curvature terms arising
after integrating out matter fields leads to apparent superluminal propagation speed for gravity on
cosmological backgrounds. Nevertheless there remains no violation of causality [27, 28].
As the previous few examples already show, applications of these compactified positivity bounds
to gravitational theories might provide genuine insights in our understanding of gravity at high energy.
Nevertheless, a few open questions remain on the validity of the procedure. Besides the subtleties asso-
ciated with defining the massless asymptotic states in 3d, it may also be unclear whether the forward
limit necessarily commutes with the ‘de-compactification’ limit (where the size of the compactified
circle is sent to infinity) [29]. So far, in most cases where the compactified positivity bounds have
been applied, neither a full nor a partial UV completion of the low-energy theories analyzed was in
fact known and hence there was no explicit way of testing their predictions. Motivated by the current

which allows us to cleanly separate them.

state-of-affairs, in this work we shall therefore apply the compactified positivity bounds to an IR the-
ory for which a partial UV completion2 is in fact known, hence providing an explicit framework where
the validity of the compactified positivity bounds can be put to the test.
In the absence of gravity, positivity bounds are automatically satisfied for renormalizable field
theories. If they were not, it would be necessary to include irrelevant operators to satisfy them, con-
tradicting the assumption of renormalizability. Our central interest will be renormalizable theories
coupled to gravity. By construction, any terms that may potentially violate positivity will necessarily
vanish in the decoupling limit MPl → ∞. A fundamentally important example of a renormalizable
theory is none other than QED. Upon minimally coupling QED to gravity, renormalizability is of
course spoiled, but this spoiling is suppressed by the Planck scale. Naively, one would expect QED or
a generic renormalizable theory minimally coupled to gravity to be a perfectly well-defined partial UV
completion. Moreover from decoupling arguments, at sufficiently low-energy scales we would expect
physics to be insensitive to how QED is fundamentally implemented into a full UV complete quantum
theory of gravity.
Inspired by QED, in this work we consider a scalar photon QED toy model where both the vector
field and the electron are treated as scalar fields [28] while leaving the case of the actual QED to a
separate work [30]. As we shall see, the compactified positivity bounds that we would have derived
from compactifying one dimension are inconsistent with the knowledge obtained directly from the
(partial) UV theory. This represents an explicit example where the positivity bounds inferred from
3d (or 4d compactified on a circle) would have led to the wrong conclusions, hence casting doubt on
the generic validity of the procedure. Naturally, the example we provide has its own limitations:
• First the model we shall propose only has a known partial UV completion and not a full one, its
non-renormalizability arises entirely from graviton exchange/loops. Nonetheless, this limitation
is a weak one as corrections from UV physics will be suppressed by additional powers of MPl.
Although one may argue that our particular example renormalizable field theory belongs to the
‘swampland’, we will show that these features are in fact common to generic renormalizable field
theories including QED itself [30], and hence applicable to theories which are known to arise
from consistent UV completions.
• Second, and perhaps more to the point, the partial UV completion we are dealing with is not a
tree-level completion (for example of the string/Regge higher spin type [25])3 since the relevant
effect from the electron arises at one loop. Yet the beauty of the positivity bounds is that they
are supposed to be agnostic of the precise type of UV completions one is dealing with, so long
as it is local, Lorentz-invariant, unitary and causal. The argument of [21] if valid, should apply
equally well for these heavy loop completions.
The derivation of the compactified positivity bounds rests on the applicability of positivity bounds
to 3d gravitational scattering amplitudes. However these are notoriously poorly defined. We critically
2By partial UV completion we mean an effective theory valid at a higher energy scale than the original low-energy
EFT. Our partial UV completions shall be theories which are renormalizable in the absence of gravity and for which
the traditional expectation would be that the cutoff of the EFT is Λ ∼MPl.
3Often in the literature this is referred to as a weakly coupled UV completion on the grounds that there must be
some dimensionless parameter that suppressed loops, a role played by the string coupling constant gs (dilaton) in string
theory. However this terminology can be confusing since the completion we consider is itself weakly coupled in the sense
that perturbation theory is under control, but the key contribution to the scattering amplitudes arise at one-loop in the
heavy field.
– 3 –
assess this in section 6 where we note that in 3d there is no scattering amplitude which simultaneously
satisfies: (a) finiteness in the forward scattering limit and (b) positivity of its imaginary part. Since
these are crucial assumptions in the derivation of positivity bounds, this casts a significant doubt
on the applicability of positivity bounds with (massless) gravity. Interestingly these issues disappear
when considering the exchange of massive spin-2 fields. On the other hand, for a massless exchange,
we show that the issue with the t-channel pole in 4d ends up manifesting itself through a slightly
different but ultimately equivalent violation of analyticity in 3d, more precisely through the presence
of a delta function. Attempting to applying the positivity bounds to 3d amplitudes where the delta
function is removed is ultimately not justified and can lead to incorrect implications.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the various positivity bounds.
We then introduce the scalar photon QED in section 3, and present the core of the inconsistency that
one runs into when applying the compactified positivity bounds of [21] to the low-energy EFT. In
section 4 we refine this discussion by introducing a spectator field to probe the consistency of the
partial UV completion, and we summarize the calculation of the amplitude in the low-energy effective
theory and the partial UV completion both before and after compactification. In section 5 we address
the question of whether the failing lies in our choice of partial UV completion by amending it with
both renormalizable and irrelevant operators indicative of new UV physics. We find that only new
physics at a parametrically low scale Λ ∼ (MMPl)1/2 can ensure the compactified positivity bounds
are satisfied, (where M would be the equivalent to the electron mass). In section 6 we take the
opposite perspective and address possible flaws with the derivation of [21], principally those due to
the ill-defined nature of 3d scattering amplitudes with massless spin-2 exchange. We point out that
positivity bounds are cleanly respected for massive spin-2 states. However for massless spin-2 states,
the issue with the 4d t-channel pole manifests itself through a delta function in 3d which ultimately
precludes the application of the positivity bounds in 3d, just as it was in 4d. All further details
and consistency checks are presented in appendices. In particular in appendix C we discuss the
compactification procedure applied to our particular partial UV completion.
2 Positivity Bounds — the relevance of the t–channel pole
In this section we lay out the procedure by which we check the consistency and implications of the
compactified positivity bounds of [21]. We shall start from a known partial UV theory containing a
heavy field that can be integrated out leading to a known IR theory. Having both the partial UV
and the IR theory at hand allows us to directly check whether the constraints that the new positivity
bounds impose on the couplings in the low-energy theory are satisfied by the information that we
have from the partial UV theory. As our UV theory we shall use a QED-type scalar field theory with
a massive ‘electron’ that we shall integrate out to obtain the IR theory — a scalar analogue of the
Einstein–Maxwell theory with higher derivative corrections with specific calculable couplings on which
we then impose the new positivity bounds as described below.
2.1 Positivity bounds
Let us start with a short review of the positivity bounds. The standard positivity bounds (see e.g.
[1–4, 13, 14]) can be applied to theories where all the fields have a mass gap, or are regulated by adding
a small mass that can later be sent to zero. We consider the elastic 2− 2 scattering (A+B → A+B)
of particles of mass m1 and m2, which necessarily respects s− u crossing symmetry, denoting by s, t

and u = 2m21 + 2m

2 − s − t the standard Mandelstam variables. The analyticity properties of the
elastic scattering amplitude A(s, t) allows to express it as a dispersion relation:

A(s′, t)
(s′ − s)
, (2.1)
where C is a contour in the complex s′ plane that includes the point s and excludes poles and branch
cuts.
The essence of the positivity bounds relies on the optical theorem for elastic scatterings with the
same particle content, i, in the initial and final state of the scattering. The imaginary part of the
forward limit amplitude of such scattering process is then
ImAi(s, 0) =

∑
f

dΠf |Ai→f |2 , (2.2)
where Ai→f is the scattering amplitude for the process i→ f with f denoting all possible intermediate
states and dΠf stands for the phase volume. Importantly, this tells us that the contribution from each
of the possible intermediate scattering processes gives a positive contribution to the imaginary part
of the amplitude. In terms of the 2 − 2 elastic scattering amplitude A, this tells us that within the
physical region, ImA(s, 0) > 0. Further positivity of the imaginary part of individual partial waves

utilize these in the forward limit t = 0

t-channel pole. Since the residue of a t-channel pole associated with the exchange of a spin J particle
scales as sJ/t at large s, we can only subtract the t-channel pole for exchanged states with spin J < 2
without contradicting the assumption that the dispersion relation (2.3) only has two subtractions.
This brings us to the essential point, in a gravitational theory with a massless graviton, the t–channel
pole scales as s2/t as in (4.11) and so cannot be removed without contradicting the assumption of two
subtractions. Therefore, in what follows the amplitude Ã(s, t) shall generically denote the amplitude
for which only the s and u–channel poles of the massless graviton exchange have been removed but
keeping the t–channel pole, whereas the s, t and u channel poles will be removed for particles with spin
J < 2. Since the t-pole cannot be subtract it dominates the forward limit rendering (2.6) contentless.
If a massless spin J ≥ 2 pole is present, there is a second major problem with the standard
arguments. The proof that ∂Nt ImA(s, 0) > 0 assumes that the partial wave expansion can be continued
from the physical region t ≤ 0 to the unphysical region t > 0 at least in the neighbourhood of t = 0.
The presence of a pole and indeed the branch point from graviton loops undermines this. This problem
is conveniently avoided for J < 2 by analytically continuing the partial wave expansion for ∂2s Ã(s, t)
for which the associated pole drops out. There remains the branch cut, but these contributions are
typically suppressed by a loop counting parameter. For J = 2 we can continue the partial wave
expansion for ∂3s Ã(s, t), at least provided we neglect graviton loops, but this amounts to performing
one additional subtraction in the dispersion relation (2.3):
A(s, t) = a0(t) + a1(t)s+ a2(t)s2 +

with the J = 2 t-channel pole now contained in a2(t). While we can infer positivity statements
for higher order s-derivative positivity bounds, we lose the most valuable information, namely the
condition (2.6), since a2(t) cannot be determined by analyticity alone.
2.2 Improved positivity bounds
Returning to the standard case with only states with J < 2, it is clear from the relation (2.2) that the
optical theorem carries much more information than what has been used to infer the positivity bound
(2.6). In particular, it is clear from the relation (2.2) that the contribution from each of the possible
intermediate scattering processes gives a positive contribution to the imaginary part of the amplitude.
We can make use of this fact by moving known contributions from the right-hand side of the theorem
to the left-hand side, thus making the positivity bounds stronger and in fact generating further bounds
on the couplings in the low-energy EFT. These go under the name of the improved positivity bounds
[7, 8, 14] and will be relevant in the discussion below when comparing different contributions to the
2 − 2 scalar scatterings. Specifically we can separate the total imaginary part into two separately
positive contributions
ImA(s, t) = ImAknown(s, t) + ImAunknown(s, t) , (2.8)

from which follows the first of many improved positivity bounds
d2Ãimp(s, 0)

> 0 , (m1 −m2)2 < s < (m1 +m2)2 . (2.11)
For instance, one obvious application is to take as ‘known’ the loop contributions calculated within the
low-energy effective theory, valid for s < �2Λ2c where Λc is the cutoff of the effective theory, and �� 1
taken small enough that we can reliably trust the calculations, with ‘unknown’ — the remainder, i.e.
ImAknown(s, t) = θ(�2Λ2c − s)ImA(s, t) , ImAunknown(s, t) = θ(s− �
2Λ2c)ImA(s, t) . (2.12)
In the present context of a renormalizable theory coupled to gravity we have processes involving both
gravitational and non-gravitational intermediate states. The improved positivity bounds, assuming
applicability once the t-pole is removed, will enable us to remove the known non-gravitational contri-
butions and focus instead on scatterings involving graviton exchange only. We refer the reader to [30]
to a detailed analysis of the implications of the improved positivity bounds in the context of QED and
the low-energy Euler–Heisenberg action.
2.3 Compactified positivity bounds
We have already highlighted the difficulties in applying the positivity bound (2.6) to amplitudes that
manifest a massless t-channel pole with residue growing as s2 (or faster), as is typically the case in
processes that involve a graviton exchange. In dealing with such a pole, Ref. [21] provided a novel
procedure for regularizing scattering amplitudes involving a massless graviton exchange. By compacti-
fying one of the spatial directions on a circle, the initial 4d scattering process can effectively be reduced
to a 3d one. Since in 3d the graviton is non-dynamical there can be no physical t-pole in the amplitude
and thus naively no obstacle in applying the standard positivity bounds leading to constraints on the
couplings in the original 4d low-energy action. In practise, a t-channel pole does remain perturbatively
but as reviewed in section 6 is expected to be removed on resummation, as is apparent in the eikonal
approximation.
In this work we shall check the consistency of these compactified positivity bounds by working
with low-energy (IR) effective field theories for which the partial UV completion is known. We refer to
appendix C for explicit details on the compactification process in our example. The advantage of this
approach is the fact that the coefficients in the IR action are in fact determined by the partial UV theory
and a direct comparison between these coefficients with the constraints that can be inferred from the
compactified positivity bounds is possible. We will critically address issues with the compactification
argument and positivity bounds applied in 3d in section 6.
3 Scalar photon QED
In this work we shall deal with a simplified version of the scalar QED where the photon is treated
as a scalar field [28]. An identical analysis can be also carried out for the vector Maxwell field, and
spinor QED where the electron is a Dirac spinor [30]. Here we focus on the scalar field example since
– 7 –
it proves useful to highlight the apparent contradictions that arise when ignoring the t-channel pole
due to the graviton exchange. We denote the “scalar photon” by φ, the “scalar electron” by ψ and
couple the two by a QED type of interaction −αMφψ2, where M is the mass of the heavy field ψ and
α is a dimensionless coupling constant. This scalar photon QED Lagrangian is

In distinction to the standard scalar QED with a massless vector field, ignoring its couplings to gravity,
this is a super-renormalizable theory and thus has a different (and better) UV behaviour. Coupling this
super-renormalizable field theory to gravity necessitates both the introduction of an Einstein–Hilbert
term and covariant derivatives, together with non-renormalizable higher derivative interactions that
require new UV physics at (or below) the Planck scale MPl. We shall return to the impact of the
latter corrections in section 5. For now we content ourselves with this theory minimally coupled to

where pUV stands for partial UV completion. It is straightforward to derive from (3.2) the low-energy
effective theory that describes the dynamics of the photon well below the electron mass. Explicitly

methods as in [31, 32] (see [33–35] for the original works) then leads to the low-energy effective action:

Let us stress that the sign of the coefficient C in front of the Rµν∂µφ∂νφ term is negative. This new
interaction redresses the kinetic term of the scalar field and thus directly affects the propagation speed
of the scalar φ on any gravitational background with a non-vanishing Ricci tensor. Intriguingly, the
sign C < 0 leads to superluminal low-energy propagation speeds relative to the background metric.
It was shown in [28], for a shockwave geometry, that despite the apparent causality violations in the
low-energy theory, these are cleanly resolved in the high-frequency regime and the front velocity re-
mains luminal. This ensures that the retarded propagator vanishes outside of the metric lightcone.
The apparent low-energy superluminal phase and group velocity can never lead to any resolvable effect
and is therefore never in tension with causality [27].
It is possible to rewrite the action (3.3) in a more familiar form by performing a local field
redefinition to remove the non-minimal couplings with the Ricci curvature. Naturally, such local
transformations leave the scattering amplitudes invariant. Transforming the metric as

with coupling a would simply conclude that the coupling needs to be positive i.e. a > 0. This specific
statement has been long known for scalar field theories in the absence of gravity [1–3]. It was presented
again in [21] where it was argued that a > 0 should hold also in the presence of gravity for any weakly
coupled5 UV completion of (3.6) by means of the compactified positivity bounds. In the present
context, the compactified positivity bounds then imply

Comparing to (3.4) and naively using the fact that M � MPl we could conclude that this bound is
always satisfied in the UV theory. Another way of seeing the bound above is to rewrite it as bound
on the charge-to-mass ratio, α/M , giving

akin very much to similar arguments in QED made to support the weak gravity conjecture [23, 24].
Thus it appears to be the case that the positivity bounds are satisfied provided that (3.9) is respected.
This conclusion is however premature. The reason for this is the fact that the operator C̃ α

in the IR action (3.6) arises from a non-gravitational loop diagram in the UV theory, shown in Fig. 1
and computed in appendix A. Rather than working with the low-energy theory (3.6) we may return
to the partial UV completion (3.2) and apply the improved positivity bounds [7, 8, 14] reviewed in
section 2.2 to remove the contribution from the box diagram6 in Fig. 1. From the low-energy point
of view this amounts to simply removing the C̃ term. Hence a UV observer applying the improved
positivity bounds, would infer instead of (3.8) the statement
C = −

5In this context we may take weakly coupled to mean calculable within a standard perturbative expansion.
6Strictly speaking we can only remove the contribution of the box diagram that comes from the low-energy branch
cut s < �2Λ2c according to (2.11), however as long as Λc � α−1/4(M3MPl)1/4 we are led to an equivalent contradiction
to (3.10).

leading to a contradiction. At this stage we are faced with the conclusion that either scalar QED
minimally coupled to gravity is not an acceptable partial UV completion, (this will be explored in
section 5 and as we shall see this would lead to unprecedented implications) — or the compactified
positivity bounds proposed in [21] can be violated in some situations despite the existence of a stan-
dard partial UV completion. We stress again that although we have focused on a relatively simple
(and uninteresting) renormalizable field theory, similar arguments are expected to hold for generic
renormalizable field theories coupled to gravity, and we will discuss explicitly the case of QED in [30].
4 Scalar photon QED with a spectator field
The discussion of the previous section can be considerably sharpened by including an additional light
spectator field χ in the UV Lagrangian (3.2). We assume that the spectator field χ interacts with the
scalar QED theory only via gravity7. For simplicity but without loss of generality, we keep both of
the scalar fields φ and χ massless here8. The scalar photon QED action minimally coupled to gravity
and including a light spectator field χ takes the form:

. (4.1)
We have assumed that the spectator χ is a scalar field here but it could in principle be any other
(fermion or vector) field coupled to gravity. In this setup we can then focus on the elastic φχ → φχ
scattering that is always mediated by the massless graviton exchange and only occurs via the t-channel
scattering. We shall provide more details in exploring the validity of the compactified positivity bounds
and analyzing the 2− 2 scattering between the spectator and matter both in the partial UV and low-
energy EFT as well as on the compactified manifold in the appendices.
4.1 Scattering in the low-energy EFT
To begin with, we determine the low-energy effective theory associated with (4.1) that arises below
the electron mass. This is straightforward following the approach of the previous section. Integrating
out the scalar electron leads to the IR action

7The trick of introducing a spectator field to probe positivity bounds was heavily used in [26]. As highlighted in
section 3, we can reach the same conclusions without introducing a spectator field, however this relies on implementing
the improved positivity bounds. The inclusion of a spectator field is only performed so as to bypass this need of going
through improved bounds. Indeed, when considering the elastic χφ→ χφ scattering there is no need to subtract other
known contributions.
8One can in principle introduce a small mass m for either of them for as long as m2/M2 � 1. We shall do so in
appendix D when considering possible extensions to the action (4.1) leading to processes with light scalar loops. However,
having a non-zero scalar field mass does not provide any additional insights in the scattering process considered in the
current section.

The new feature is the contact interaction (∂µφ∂
µχ)2 which contributes directly to the χφ → χφ
scattering. As usual the scattering amplitude is a physical quantity and is independent on the field
redefinitions that we have performed to get to the form of the IR action as in (4.3). The field redefi-
nition is merely used as a tool to make this interaction more explicit.
At the leading order the χφ→ χφ scattering in the IR theory occurs via two different scattering
processes shown in Fig. 2. As compared to the previous case, there is a new contact interaction directly
between the two fields φ and χ. For the leading order scattering amplitude we then find

As argued in [21] and as shown in appendix C applying the compactified forward limit positivity
bounds for this amplitude amounts to dropping the t-pole and requiring that

leading to the requirement that C > 0. In other words, the new positivity bounds state that for this IR
theory (4.3) to have a standard (local and Lorentz invariant) UV completion the coupling constant C
has to be positive. However, comparing (4.5) to the corresponding amplitude (4.11) computed below
in the UV theory we read off
C = −

which contradicts the positivity bound above. It shows that a theory can have an apparently healthy
partial UV completion (given in (4.1)) even though the compactified positivity bounds are violated.
4.2 Scattering in the UV completion
In the previous subsection we have seen that on introducing a spectator field into the partial UV
completion, the compactified positivity bounds applied to the low-energy effective theory are violated,
and no condition analogous to (3.9) can be imposed to save them. Thus (4.1) is a particularly straight-
forward example of a partial UV completion that would be expected to be well-defined, but for which

compactified positivity bounds are violated. In section 5 we will discuss possible corrections to the
partial UV completion that may rectify this. For now we would like to see how positivity bounds
applied directly to the UV theory (4.1) play out.
This calculation may be performed in two different ways. We may first compute the scattering
amplitude in the partial UV completion in 4d Minkowski R3,1, and use this to match against the
low-energy effective theory to confirm the results in the previous section. The compactified positivity
bounds may then be applied directly in the IR EFT as per the previous section. Alternatively we
may apply the compactification procedure directly to the partial UV completion (4.1). These two
procedures are not identical because in the former, the electron loop is computed in 4d Minkowski
R3,1, whereas in the latter it is computed on a compactified space R2,1×S1. Performing the calculation
both ways allows us to test whether there is any issue in running the argument due to failure of the
limits L → ∞ and the low-energy limit E/M → 0 to commute. The former calculation implicitly
assumes MKK �M , whereas the latter is applicable also when MKK �M . We will save the technical
details for appendix B for the R3,1 calculation and appendix C for the R2,1 × S1 and review the
essential results here.
4.2.1 Electron loops in 4d Minkowski R3,1
The contributions to the tree-level and one-loop χφ → χφ scattering amplitude ApUV(s, t) relevant
for the positivity bounds in the partially UV complete theory (4.1) come from the diagrams given in
Fig. 3, and in the notations of appendix B are
ApUV(s, t) = Zφ ×Atree,0 +Aφψ2 +Aφψ2h . (4.8)
Given the wave function renormalization

with A(s, t) ≡ −s(s + t)(−1 + x + y)2 + M2t and ∆ ≡ M2 − xyt. Let us note that, as expected,
this amplitude is independent from the renormalization scale. To see this cancellation explicitly we
have followed the same procedure as highlighted in appendix D.1.1. The role of the wavefunction
renormalization is to ensure that the terms in square brackets contain no net contribution to the
t-pole. This confirms the equivalence principle at the quantum level, namely that the graviton only
couples to the physical energy at the strength MPl. The remaining part of the amplitude contains no
s-channel branch cut or pole, i.e. there is no imaginary part for physical values of s. This is the virtue
of introducing the spectator field whose interactions only arise through gravity. Hence there are no
dispersive imaginary parts to remove via improved positivity bounds and we may just apply the usual
positivity bounds.
Expanding at low-energy, we confirm the amplitude determined from the low-energy effective
theory as expected
ApUV(s, t) = −

where O(t0) stands for all other contributions to the amplitude that are finite, non-singular and have
no s2 dependence. Applying the prescription suggested in Ref. [21] allows us to ignore the t-pole so
that the positivity bound of Eq. (2.6) implies
d2ApUV,no pole(s, 0)
ds2
= −
2α2
90(4π)2M2M2Pl

which cannot be satisfied for any real values of the coupling α.
Closer inspection of (4.10) shows that even with the t-channel pole removed, the remaining part
of the amplitude in square brackets grows as s2 for fixed t at large s, thus invalidating the assumption
lim|s|→∞ s
−2A(s, t) → 0. This should not come as a surprise since (4.1) in itself only a partial UV
completion by virtue of being gravitational, and new physics will come in at higher energies to resolve
this. How precisely this new physics manifests itself i.e. whether new physics enters through higher
spins or through other fields is irrelevant to this point, the central issue is rather about the scale at
which this new physics enters. The naive expectation would be that the cutoff is the Planck scale, or
the string scale, but as we shall see the cutoff ought to be much lower for the compactified positivity
bounds to be satisfied. This possibility is indeed explored in section 5 where we show that in order for
our partial UV completion (4.1) to admit a full UV completion for which the compactified positivity
bounds apply, new physics has to be introduced at a scale Λ significantly lower than the Planck scale
Λ ∼ (MMPl)1/2. From the EFT perspective, we know that this result is obtained in a naively sensible
effective field theory (4.1) where the EFT cutoff — induced by the presence of the Einstein–Hilbert
term and the minimal coupling to gravity — would naively be expected to coincide with the Planck
scale, or a scale close to it. Given the simplicity of the model in (4.1) and its resemblance to the
standard QED this would be a very strong statement with far-reaching implications to even Standard
Model physics. It seems more likely that these findings point to some inconsistency in the handling
of the t-channel pole.
4.2.2 Electron loops in the compactified R2,1 × S1 space
In order to make sure that the simplified prescription of dropping the t-pole does indeed follow from
the regularization procedure suggested in [21] we shall repeat the same strategy to the partial UV com-
pletion (4.1). The technical details are found in appendix C. This calculation is most straightforwardly

5 New UV physics
The physical motivation of the specific interactions in our UV theory (4.1) is clearly that of its
resemblance to the standard QED. As our computations in section 4 clearly show, if we were to apply
the compactified positivity bounds of Ref. [21] to the IR theory (4.3) we would conclude that the
theory only admits a standard UV completion if the coefficient C is positive. On the other hand the
known partial UV completion (4.1) gives C < 0 in Eq. (4.7). As already alluded to, there may be
different reasons for this disagreement:
(a) Either the compactified positivity bounds do not generically apply. This could be due to many
reasons: One issue highlighted in [29] is that the argument relies on taking the forward limit
before the large L limit. However as we have seen in the previous section, positivity is violated
for any L for t ∼ 0 and the 3d theory (4.20) by itself violates positivity. This suggests that any
problems relate directly to the subtleties intrinsic to 3d gravitational theories and 3d scattering
amplitudes. We will highlight some of these in the next section 6.
(b) Or the compactified positivity bounds are indeed always valid and in this context they imply
that by itself the partial UV completion (4.1) (or (3.2)) minimally coupled to gravity is not a
valid one, at least not without the existence of new UV physics at a scale parametrically lower
than the Planck scale.
In this section we shall consider the second possibility. There are two relatively straightforward
possibilities for enhancing the partial UV theory in attempting to satisfy the new positivity bounds.
Both rely on introducing interactions already at the level of the partial UV theory, thus providing a
different UV completion from the one presented in (4.1). The distinction between the two possibilities
is whether the new interactions would be renormalizable or non-renormalizable in the absence of
gravity.
5.1 Renormalizable operators
In the actual QED case there are of course no further renormalizable interactions in 4 dimensions.
However, in our scalar photon QED model (4.1) we could supplement (4.1) with the additional terms

each of which is renormalizable in the absence of gravity. The terms with coefficients di will not
contribute to χφ→ χφ scattering at one-loop order and we do not consider them any further in what
follows. The remaining interactions are discussed in great detail in appendix D. As before in all cases
once the wavefunction renormalization is accounted for, the t-pole is universally −s2/(M2Plt). The
additional contributions to the positivity bound are

. (5.2)
For any choice of coefficients a, b these contributions are negative and so cannot solve the contradic-
tion. Thus we see that quite generically renormalizable field theories minimally coupled to gravity
tend to violate the compactified positivity bounds.
– 15 –
We could also imagine introducing additional renormalizable interactions between the spectator χ
and the other matter fields φ and ψ. These are considered in detail in appendix E. The story is quite
analogous, all contributions to the positivity bounds are negative except that from the box diagram
pictured in Fig. 12b in appendix E. However the reason this gives a positive contribution is that it is
a non-gravitational contribution that itself satisfies the Froissart bound. Hence it may be removed by
application of the improved positivity bounds. We thus find that no introduction of renormalizable
interactions, even with the spectator field, resolves the contradiction.
5.2 Non-renormalizable operators
We are thus led to looking at modifying the partial UV completion by introducing new physics at a
higher energy scale Λ�M . For instance this may be new physics at the Planck scale, or a lower scale
such as the string scale. In the latter case the UV completion may require the introduction of a tower
of higher spin Regge states [25]. Regardless of what this new physics is, it will show up at low energies
as irrelevant operators extending the partial UV completion (4.1). Indeed, it is straightforward to
introduce new irrelevant operators so as to satisfy the compactified positivity bounds. The price to
pay is the fact that these irrelevant interactions must come in at a scale much lower than the Planck
scale — hence significantly reducing the cutoff of the partial UV theory (4.1). We discuss this case in
detail in this section.
The most obvious way to ensure the compactified positivity bounds are satisfied is to supplement
that partial UV completion (4.1) with the irrelevant operator
∆L =
√
−g BRµν∂µφ∂νφ , (5.3)
where B is a dimensionful coupling. On integrating out the ψ loop, the net contribution to the IR
action (4.2) from this interaction will then by
L(J)IR =

Rµν∂µφ∂νφ , (5.4)
and so by choosing
B > −C
α2
M2
, (5.5)
the compactified positivity bound will be satisfied. The problem is since this is an irrelevant operator
it will induce a new cutoff in the effective theory. To determine this cutoff it is helpful to perform
in the partial UV completion (4.1) with the additional operator (5.3) a field redefinition analogous
to (3.5)
gµν → gµν +
2B

M2Pl
(
(∂µφ∂

+ . . . . (5.7)
These obviously give another scattering channel contributing to the χφ→ χφ scattering amplitude in
the UV theory allowing to satisfy the positivity bound as stated above. Assuming α ∼ O(1) then this
is an irrelevant operator9 of the form M2PlR(∂φ)
2/Λ4 with cutoff of at most Λ ∼ (MMPl)1/2.
9A priori the irrelevant operator contains a term behaving as ∂2h(∂φ)2/(MPlM
2) which would suggest an even lower
cutoff however this particular term is removable by a field redefinition and does not enter the amplitude. Ultimately
the irrelevant operator that has to be included in the EFT ought to affect the amplitude at the scale Λ ∼ (MMPl)1/2.

Terms such as (∂χ)2(∂ψ)2 will not contribute to s dependence of χφ → χφ scattering and may be
ignored. The new diagrams relevant for the one-loop χφ→ χφ scattering are shown in Fig. 4:
• The diagram in Fig. 4a is a simple contact diagram that we have already computed in section 4.1
with the corresponding vertex Vφ2χ2 given in (B.1). For the scattering amplitude in the forward
limit it gives
Aφ2χ2(s, 0) =

s2 contribution to the χφ→ χφ scattering amplitude provided

Importantly, this implies that the scale of the new non-renormalizable interaction that we are
adding in (5.8) has to be Λ ≤ (MMPl)1/2 � MPl. Hence, the new positivity bounds can be
satisfied in a UV theory with new derivative interactions that become important at a scale
Λ�MPl. Notably, in comparison to our initial UV theory (4.1) this means that the EFT cutoff
decreases from MPl to Λ. We will discuss the implications of this low cutoff in more detail below.
• The diagram in Fig. 4b is new. The corresponding interaction in (5.8) gives the same vertex,
Vψ2χ2 as in the previous step with φ↔ ψ and δ ↔ γ. The amplitude of the process shown is

Comparing this with the scattering amplitude computed in the initial UV theory we find again
that in order for the total contribution to the s2 term to be positive the EFT cutoff scale should
be Λ ≤ (MMPl)1/2 �MPl.
• The operators considered in (5.8) contribute to the χφ → χφ through other diagrams at up to
one–loop but all other contributions are suppressed compared with the ones mentioned previously
and depicted in Fig. 4. Relying on those to ensure that the compactified positivity bounds are
satisfied for the χφ→ χφ amplitude would only lead to an even smaller cutoff.
We should also account for the role of irrelevant cubic operators. For instance the dimension 5

While the sign can be engineered to be positive, for this to compensate the negative contributions, we
would need the cutoff at the scale Λ ∼M which is worse than what is needed for quartic interactions.
In addition this will lead to a simple tree-level ψ exchange process but this does not give rise to any
s dependence.
5.3 φφ→ φφ scattering
So far we have only explored the compactified positivity bounds for the χφ → χφ amplitude as the
presence of the spectator considerably simplifies the discussion. However as discussed in section 3,
applying a similar type of 3d regularization argument to the improved positivity bounds for the
φφ → φφ scattering would lead to a similar contradiction. Attempting to resolve this effect through
– 18 –
the introduction of new operators in the partial UV completion would, for instance, require the operator
(∂φ)4 in (5.8) to give a dominant contribution over that from the electron loop, leading to the condition

Hence also the irrelevant φ self-interactions have to occur at or below the scale Λ = (MMPl)

5.4 EFT of two light scalars
The findings of the previous sections point strongly towards the fact that scalar field theories that would
otherwise be renormalizable in the absence of gravity, would be forced to carry non-renormalizable
interactions at a scale much lower than the Planck scale in the presence of gravity if we insisted on
imposing the compactified positivity bounds. As another argument in favour of this finding is the
example of two light scalar fields coupled to gravity and described by the action

We have computed all the necessary ingredients for the χφ → χφ scattering in the subsections B.1,
D.1.1, D.2. All the s2 contributions to the scattering amplitude were found to be negative and
are thus in contradiction with the compactified positivity bounds. We have also considered possible
renormalizable couplings between the two fields: χφ2, φχ2 in appendix E. All of these are still negative.
Similarly as in the action (5.8) the only positive s2 contribution to the scattering amplitude can arise
from the derivative interaction

leading again to Λ . (mphMPl)

interactions at a scale well below the Planck scale. Applying this argumentation to for example single
field inflation and scalar field dark matter of mass m would seem to ‘predict’ interactions between
these fields and all other scalar fields in the nature (e.g. the Higgs boson) at a scale at or below
(mMPl)
1/2.
5.5 Summary of new UV physics
To put in perspective the implications of the previous bounds, let us go back to the analogy between
the model (5.8) and QED minimally coupled to gravity, where M plays the role of the electron mass.
The ‘need’ for operators of the form (∂χ∂φ)2 for any light (scalar) field χ even if it had no contact with
φ other than gravitationally, would seem to suggest, in this analogy with QED, that photons ought to
couple for instance with dark matter and with any other light field, including themselves at or below
the scale Λ = (MMPl)
1/2. Taking M to be the electron mass would lead to interactions at or below the
scale Λ ∼ 1016eV. While this is a relatively high scale, it would still have profound consequences for
our understanding of the Standard Model. While of course these contributions disappear in the limit
MPl →∞ where gravity decouples, such a phenomenon would require a cutoff for gravity coupled to
matter well below the Planck scale, which would be a statement of unprecedented magnitude.

6 Infrared Regulator and 3d gravity
In the previous section we have seen that generic renormalizable field theories coupled to gravity violate
the compactified positivity bounds unless new physics is introduced at the low scale Λ = (MMPl)
1/2.
This is a remarkably strong conclusion and to take its implications seriously we should be clear that the
assumptions taken in its derivation are valid. One concern relates to the compactification procedure
and whether the limits t → 0 and L → ∞ can be taken to commute as noted in [29]. Explicit
calculations at fixed L show that the positivity bounds are violated for finite nonzero t and for any L
so this seems unlikely to be the issue. Furthermore it seems implausible that we are either not allowed
to consider 3d compactifications, or that we are not allowed to consider the 3d theory (4.20) in its own
right. Far more likely the issue lies with the very poorly defined nature of 3d scattering amplitudes
with massless gravitons [22, 36–38].
6.1 IR regulated 3d amplitudes
The central issue is that in 3 dimensions, a point particle generates a conical deficit angle and as such
its influence is felt at arbitrarily large distances [39, 40]. This means that the traditional notion of an
S-matrix is poorly defined. In perturbation theory this shows up as infrared divergences that need
to be regulated. One way to regulate the infrared behaviour is to add a mass to the graviton. In
this section we shall focus on the effect of such a regulator on the eikonal scattering amplitude. For
instance, a static particle with mass M∗ can be described by the cosmic string metric with deficit
angle δ = M∗
2πM3
, where M3 is the 3d Planck scale
ds2 = −dt2 + e−2δ ln r(dr2 + r2dθ2) , (6.1)
with θ ∈ [0, 2π]. This can be regulated by
ds2 = −dt2 + e2φ(r)(dr2 + r2dθ2) , (6.2)
for which the regulated Newtonian potential satisfies
−∇22φ(r) +m

gφ(r) =

δ2(x) , (6.3)
with mg the graviton mass. The large distance Yukawa fall-off of φ renders scattering in the regulated
metric (6.2) well-defined. For a massless particle of energy ω scattering in this geometry, in the eikonal
limit the scattering phase shift is [22]

may rescale the scattering amplitude by an IR divergent phase (which should not change the physics)

Note however that the phase shift redefinition (6.5) is far from innocent. The positivity bound ar-
guments rely on the assumption that the fixed t scattering amplitude respects the Jin-Martin bound
lim|s|→∞ s
−2A(s, t) = 0 for all complex s on the first Riemann sheet. If this were not the case, we could
not have written the assumed dispersion relation. When there is a mass gap, and for mg > 0 we expect
the 3d Froissart bound to hold [41]. However the redefinition (6.5) factorizes out an entire function
that is not polynomially bounded, and grows exponentially in the lower half of the complex s plane,
undermining the boundedness assumptions. We thus have no reason to expect that the regulated 3d
scattering amplitudes for mg = 0 respect any polynomial boundedness.
6.2 Unitarity in 3d
Even more damning though is the failure for the scattering amplitude to have the assumed analyticity
structure, positivity and smoothness properties. By assumption, if the scattering amplitude were to
satisfy lim|s|→∞ s
−2A(s, t) = 0 for fixed t with only the usual poles and branch cuts, then up to the
unknown subtraction constants and known poles, it should be entirely determined by its imaginary
part ImA(s, t) for s ≥ 0. From the 3d partial wave expansion in the physical region, we have
A(s, t) =

is obviously positive if the sum is convergent, as are ∂Nt ImA(s, 0). Assuming the validity of the eikonal
result for mg → 0 (6.6) at large `, or at least that lim|`|→∞ δ`(s) = −α(s)|`|, this series diverges. In
the IR regulated case (6.4) it is by contrast convergent for fixed s as the graviton mass enforces an
effective maximum angular momentum `max ∼ s2mgM∗ .
By contrast the usual implicit approach in the massless case [22, 40] is to enforce convergence with
an implicit i� regulator, take
ImA(s, t) = 4

This is qualitatively similar to the regulated case with � ∼ 1/`max, the difference being that the
regulated problem enforces convergence by having δ`(s) → 0 for ` > `max. For a phase shift of

expression is divergent
ImA(s, 0) = 8π

s δ̃(0) ∼ 8
√
s �−1 . (6.15)
As noted in [40] the optical theorem is no longer strictly valid due to the lack of smoothness of these
functions. Note that the first delta function δ̃(θ) =
∑
n δ(θ+2πn) arising in (6.13) is not the same one
that arises from the no-scattering process 1̂ in the S-matrix split Ŝ = 1̂+iT̂ since this has already been
subtracted out in (6.8). It is a direct reflection of the ill-defined nature of the scattering amplitude
in 3d with massless gravitons due to the absence of clearly defined asymptotic states. By contrast in
the IR regulated case the imaginary part of the forward amplitude (6.10) is finite, and only diverges
as mg → 0.
6.3 Failure of positivity in 3d
It is the previous lack of smoothness for the amplitude A(s, t) near t = 0 that is the root of the failure
of positivity in 3d as we now show. Given the divergence of the imaginary part, we could just take the
perspective of simply discarding the contribution from the delta function δ̃(θ) =
∑
δ(θ + 2πn) from
(6.13) leaving the other two δ̃’s, which would amount to working with an amplitude in the form
Â(s, t) =

√
s

∞∑
`=−∞
ei`θe2iδ`(s)e−�|`| . (6.16)
This is in fact the approach of [22]. Again taking δ`(s) = −α(s)|`| then explicitly evaluating the sum
in the physical region gives
Â(s, t) = 4
(
s
√
s sin(2α(s)− i�)
s cos(2α(s)− i�)− s− 2t
)
. (6.17)
Most importantly we see that this expression is finite in the forward limit confirming the removal
of the t-channel pole. The eikonal approximation for the scattering of two massless particles gives
δ`(s) = −α(s)|`| with α(s) = β
√
s with β = 1/(4M3) [22]. In the forward limit t = 0, this expression
(6.17) is finite and given by
Â(s, 0) = −4

However, it is now apparent that Im Â(s, 0) < 0 and so positivity is lost. Indeed more generally
working with Â(s, t) we have
Im Â(s, t) = −4

, (6.21)
which is sign indefinite even in the forward limit, and so destroys the crucial positivity property utilized
in the dispersion relation arguments. Unitarity is of course still intact |e2iδ`(s)|≤ 1, but its implication
for the positivity of the dispersion relation is different.
They key point is that the standard statement of unitary rests on the decomposition Ŝ = 1̂ + iT̂ ,
so that −i(T̂ − T̂ †) = T̂ T̂ †, which relies on the notion that there is some probability for no scattering.
However in 3d massless gravity, it would be impossible to have a scenario where no scattering occurs
since each mass distorts the metric at infinity by means of a deficit angle. This is why if we try to
enforce the split Ŝ = 1̂ + iT̂ as in (6.8), then the resulting scattering amplitude will result in a delta
function that compensates the 1̂ as in (6.13). The amplitude which is well-defined is Â which follows
directly from −iŜ, but this does not have a positive imaginary part since unitarity is realized through
(−iŜ)(−iŜ)† = 1̂.
6.4 Analytic structure of the amplitude in 3d
A closer inspection of (6.18) shows that it has the wrong analytic structure. If we attempt to construct
the function from its imaginary part via a dispersion integral we obtain rather

which has the same imaginary part but opposite sign real part in the physical region. The reason for
this failure can be traced to the eikonal expression for the partial wave S-matrix e2iδ`(s) = e−2iβ

s|`|.
Analytically continuing into the Euclidean region via a counterclockwise rotation s = eiπsE gives the
exponentially growing behaviour e2iδ`(s) = e2β

This failure of analyticity can be attributed to the failure of the eikonal approximation for the phase
shift. This can be solved by a variant application of the eikonal approximation for which the sum
(6.16) is replaced by an integral over `, giving
Â(s, t) ∼

which are bounded analytic functions up to a right-hand branch cut and multiple poles at s = −β−2.
The expression (6.25) is a crossing symmetric, analytic function of s for fixed t ≤ 0 up to poles
at fixed t ≤ 0 with positive imaginary parts Im Â(s, t) > 0 for t ≤ 0. It would then appear to satisfy
everything we desire for a 3d scattering amplitude. Nevertheless this positivity of the imaginary part
is accidental rather than implied by unitarity due to (6.21). This is most apparent from the fact that
the imaginary part vanishes in the forward limit despite nonzero contributions from individual partial
waves
Im Â(s, 0) = πb(0)δ(s− µ(0)) = 0 , (6.27)

is purely real even though every partial wave contributes with a non-zero imaginary part. Furthermore
the imaginary part of the fixed angle θ amplitude (6.25) is negative. Even if the expression (6.25) is
used within the context of improved positivity bounds to remove the eikonal contribution, there is no
reason to expect that the remaining imaginary part would be positive, due the lack of positivity of
(6.21). We thus conclude that there is no form of 3d scattering amplitude which is both smooth or at
least finite at t = 0 and for which positivity of its imaginary part is guaranteed to hold. Since both
these properties are needed together for the derivation of positivity bounds we conclude that they do
not apply in 3 dimensions.
6.5 Positivity recovered with a mass gap
If, as implied in the previous subsections, it is indeed correct that the problems associated with the
compactified positivity derivation are the ill-defined IR behaviour of the amplitude A (as defined in
(6.8)) and the associated lack of positivity of the amplitude Â (as defined in (6.21)), then these issues
would be resolved if the spin-2 states were massive, for which we may return to using A. As we shall
see, this is indeed the case and the positivity bounds are only problematic in the case of a massless
graviton exchange, not for a massive one.
Returning to the four dimensional amplitude, had we considered the exchange of a massive spin-2
field of mass mg, the corresponding result for the scattering amplitude would be instead

As expected, the only relevant effect is the shift of the t-channel pole away from the origin, while the
overall sign remains unaffected. In particular we emphasize that the slight modification of the polar-
ization structure of the massive vs massless spin-2 propagator bears no consequences to this discussion.
The presence of a mass gap allows us to safely continue the partial wave expansion from the
physical region t ≤ 0 to the region 0 ≤ t < m2g without fear of admonition. The positivity bounds can
then be applied for any t in the region 0 ≤ t < m2g [13]. Remarkably, the amplitude ApUVm manifestly
satisfies the positivity bounds as expected. To see this we denote t = xm2g + τ with 0 < x < 1 and
expand in τ

without any assumption on the magnitude of α. This strongly suggests that any issue with satisfying
the positivity bounds in the massless case is not an issue with the partial UV theory considered in this
work, rather, it suggests that the contradiction apparent in (4.12) with the compactified positivity
bounds with a massless graviton is due to the absence of a mass gap in the massless case and the
associated poor IR behaviour. The fact that positivity bounds are applicable for massive spin-2 states
has been used extensively in recent works [4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 42, 43].
7 Conclusions
Positivity bounds are expected to apply to gravitational theories whenever there exists a clean decou-
pling limit MPl →∞ for which the graviton decouples from other degrees of freedom. This is the case
whenever the low-energy scattering amplitude takes the schematic form
A(s, t) ∼ −

s2 + . . . , (7.1)
with c ∼ O(1) for which we may scale MPl →∞ for fixed M so that the non-gravitational positivity
bounds imply c > 0. Related arguments have been given in Ref. [25], where it is argued that positivity
bounds should apply for tree-level UV completions when the higher spin states Reggeizing graviton
exchange are subdominant in the matter (e.g. photon) scattering.11 In the examples discussed here,
the scattering amplitude rather takes the form

11A weakly–coupled tree-level UV completion is often assumed “as a safety net” for practical computational purposes
in applying the positivity bounds so as to ensure that amplitudes are dominated by tree-level diagrams, however the
positivity bounds themselves as expressed for instance in (2.6) are derived with no prior limitation on the type of UV
realization, so long as it is a standard one as far locality, unitarity, Lorentz invariance and causality are concerned.
– 25 –
with c̃ ∼ O(1). In this situation we can no longer decouple gravity without making the whole effect
vanish (or bringing the cutoff to zero). Furthermore in all of our examples, c̃ arises from loop effects
rather than tree-level/higher spin UV physics and so is not covered by the argument of [25]. It is
thus no longer clear whether we require c̃ > 0. As discussed in [27], for the scaling (7.1), having
c ∼ O(1) < 0 clearly leads to superluminal propagation and violation of causality, which is consistent
with previous expectations on the connection between positivity bounds [1, 2] and causality [3]. By
contrast for the scaling (7.2), c̃ ∼ O(1) < 0 does not lead to any resolvable violation of microcausality
[27, 28]. Consequently we can no longer rely on causality arguments to argue for any bound on c̃.
The proposed compactified positivity bounds of [21] attempt to bypass this by using positivity of 3d
scattering amplitudes to indirectly infer c̃ > 0 even for the scaling choice (7.2). If true, these would
have profound consequences, most notably for the weak gravity conjecture [21, 23–25].
In the present article, we have shown that these proposed compactified positivity bounds are
generically violated for typical renormalizable theories coupled to gravity unless new physics is intro-
duced at the parametrically low scale Λ ∼ (MMPl)1/2. One may take the perspective that this simply
implies that our renormalizable theory lies in the swampland, however this result remains relatively
stable under relevant and marginal deformations, and similar observations hold for the more realistic
case of QED [30]. Such a conclusion about the low scale Λ ∼ (MMPl)1/2 would have profound impli-
cations for our understanding of the landscape of theories with consistent Lorentz invariant, analytic,
UV completions.
There are however as discussed in section 6 a number of technical issues with the derivation of the
compactified positivity bounds proposed in [21] that prevents us from immediately accepting these
conclusions. Most critical is the fact that 3d scattering amplitudes in the presence of massless spin-2
particles are poorly defined, not least because gravitational interactions do not vanish at infinity. This
shows up as singular behaviour in the usual definition of the scattering amplitude in the forward limit.
We show explicitly that attempting to remove this singular behaviour gives a scattering amplitude
that does respect analyticity but no longer respects positivity of its imaginary part (despite unitarity
being intact). This undermines the applicability of any positivity bound to 3d gravitational scattering
amplitudes (at least for massless gravitons) and shows how the issues with the 4d massless t-channel
pole manifest themselves through slightly different but ultimately equivalent pathologies in 3d.
Conjecture: We conclude by postulating a conjecture on the implications of the t–channel pole
subtracted positivity bounds and the amount by which they may in principle be violated assuming that
the arguments of [21] are indeed flawed. Given a theory with a scattering amplitude with low-energy
expansion of the form (7.1) where M is the cutoff of the low-energy EFT, we can at most expect a
bound in the weak sense
c > −
M2
M2Pl
×O(1) . (7.3)
Generically this seems to suggest that even though negative coefficients could in principle be com-
patible with standard high-energy completion, they ought to be highly suppressed, and the scaling
with MPl is such that one recovers the standard positivity bounds c > 0 whenever a decoupling
limit MPl → ∞ can be taken. Even if suppressed, allowing for the very possibility of a having small
negative coefficients would have important implications for the weak gravity conjecture where one of
its manifestations relies precisely on operators suppressed with the precise same powers of MPl, [24, 25].
– 26 –
As mentioned previously, it is likely that the bound (7.3) can be further refined to c > 0 using
appropriate scaling arguments for a restricted class of UV completions, for instance for tree level higher
spin/Regge state UV completions with subdominant couplings to matter as argued in [25]. Interest-
ingly, this would imply that observing a negative coefficient c experimentally could be interpreted as
indications against these types of completions.
The scaling of the bound (7.3) is similar to that found in [27] where it was argued that superlu-
minalities within low-energy gravitational theories are consistent with causality and can emerge from
standard and causal high-energy completions so long as the amount of superluminality scales simi-
larly at least as M−2Pl and vanishes in a decoupling limit where gravity decouples for which traditional
causality arguments apply. In the specific case of scalar QED this is consistent with the observa-
tions of [28]. Future work is needed to better understand the role of both causality and positivity in
gravitational effective theories.

A One–loop electron contribution to photon scattering in scalar QED
In this appendix we shall provide the key steps for determining the one–loop electron contribution
to the φφ → φφ scattering amplitude as illustrated in Fig. 1. Accounting for the three channels, the
amplitude is given by
Aψ−box = Aψ−box(s, t, u) +Aψ−box(s, u, t) +Aψ−box(t, u, s) , (A.1)
where the individual amplitudes read
Aψ−box(s, t, u) =

and the denominator is given by ∆ = M2 +sz(x+y+z−1)− txy. The integration region R is defined
as R = {x, y, z ∈ R |x, y, z ≥ 0, x + y + z ≤ 1}. Going to the forward limit (t = 0) we can evaluate
this amplitude in an expansion of s

with k2i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. This result is independent on the spacetime dimension and shows the
presence of a t-channel pole in the tree-level scattering of two scalar fields via a massless graviton
exchange.
Before we set off computing the one-loop amplitudes let us note that the −αMφψ2 interaction
introduces a shift in the self-energy of φ in the resummed propagator and leads to wavefunction
renormalization Zφ defined as

There are a few important features of this amplitude that need to be discussed. First, it is easy to see
that the quantity ∆, appearing in both the denominator and the logarithm in the expression above,
vanishes for t ≥ 4M2, and implies that there is a branch cut for these values of t. While it is thus
apparent that the amplitude Aφψ2(s, t) is non-analytic for t ≥ 4M2 we see that it is polynomial and
thus analytic in s (the only s-dependence appears in the quantity A(s, t) defined above). Second, as
we shall show in detail below the amplitude exhibits a t-channel pole, i.e. Aφψ2(s, t) ∼ α

M2
Pl

t
+ . . . . In
the low-energy EFT such a contribution to the scattering amplitude can be obtained in the presence
of a new operator ∼ α2
√
−g(∂φ)2, corresponding to a redressing of the kinetic term of φ. Indeed,
as we shall see, this pole cancels out in the total amplitude for the χφ → χφ scattering once the
wavefunction renormalization of eq. (B.8) is taken into account. Finally, the amplitude has a finite s2
contribution thus implying that the positivity bounds (2.6) would give a non-trivial constraint on the
parameters of the theory. Let us address the two latter points in detail now.
• t-pole:
In order to find the contribution to the t-pole, it is sufficient to evaluate the integrands of the
– 30 –
full amplitude Aφψ2 at t = 0. Since B(t = 0) = 0 this gives
iAφψ2, pole(s, t) =

where A(s, t = 0) ≡ −s2(−1 + x+ y)2 and ∆|t=0 = M
2 making it easy to perform the integrals
over Feynman variables. As a result we obtain:
iAφψ2, pole(s, t) = −
iα2
M2Plt
s2
3(4π)2
. (B.17)
This combines with the result from the tree amplitude in (B.9) as
iAt−pole = iZφ ×Atree,0 + iAφψ2, pole = −
is2
4M2Plt
+O(t0) , (B.18)
and we see that the O(α2) contribution to the t-pole has cancelled leaving only the original tree-
level pole. From the definition of A(s, t) and B(t) we see that all their next order contributions
are proportional to t and the amplitude is thus finite in the forward limit.
• s2 contribution:
To find the relevant s2 contribution to the total amplitude (B.15) it is sufficient to expand the
integrand around t = 0. Indeed, we know that the amplitude is analytic for t ≤ 4M2 and that
the positivity bounds will be applied in the forward limit with t = 0. This makes the small
t expansion a valid approximation. We are then only interested in the s2t contribution in the
integrand which cancels the t in the overall denominator and leads to a finite s2 contribution to
the scattering amplitude. Since the only s2 dependence is in the quantity A(s, t) we obtain:
iAφψ2, s2(s, t) =

B.2.2 Aφψ2h amplitude
The last step in computing the total scattering amplitude for the process χφ→ χφ is determining the
contribution from the one-loop process shown in Fig. 6c. This is given by

where again the 1/2 is the symmetry factor of the diagram and there is an extra factor of 2 as the loop
can be on either external φ leg. After introducing the Feynman parameter x, shifting the momentum
to kµ ≡ pµ + xkµ3 and taking the integral as in dimensional regulation in (B.2) for d = 4− � we obtain

C Compactified Amplitudes in the Partial UV Theory
We now apply explicitly the procedure suggested in Ref. [21] to our model and show how the contradic-
tion (4.12) manifests itself in that formalism. We compactify one of the spatial directions (denoted here
by z) on a circle of length L. In this section we denote the 4d metric by ĝMN where N,M = 0, . . . , 3
and parameterize it as
ĝMN = e
−σ
(
e2σgµν + VµVν Vµ
Vν 1
)
, (C.1)
where the Greek indices µ, ν are the 3d ones. The heavy scalar ψ can be expanded into KK modes
ψ(xM ) =
∑
n
e
2πinz
L ψn(x
µ) , (C.2)
so that ψ(z+L) = ψ(z). A similar decomposition can be used for all the other fields we are interested
in. However, in what follows we shall focus on scatterings of the zero KK modes φ0χ0 → φ0χ0 for which
(to the order we are working in), only the zero modes of the gravitational fields σ, Vµ, gµν contribute.
Without loss of generality and in order to avoid unnecessarily heavy notation, in what follows we
shall therefore simply denote by σ, Vµ, gµν the zero modes of the gravitational fields. Focusing on the
zero KK modes for all fields aside from the heavy scalar ψ and integrating our model (4.1) over the
compactified direction we thus get

The diagrams contributing to the χ0φ0 → χ0φ0 scattering up to one-loop order are shown in Fig. 7.
Since we are only interested in contributions to the scattering amplitude that grow as s2 we have
dropped other diagrams, like the one in Fig. 8. The computation of the scattering amplitude is very
similar to the 4d case shown in great detail in appendix B. Here we only show the main results of the
computation. Taking care of the appropriate canonical normalizations the vertices expressed in (B.1)

We then find the s2 contribution — relevant for the positivity bounds (2.6) — by evaluating the

we indeed re-
cover (4.11).
We note that formally the pole s2/t is also present in the regularized amplitude (C.12). However,
since there are no propagating massless spin-2 fields in 3d, this pole cannot be physical. This can be
seen in the eikonal approximation as discussed in section 6. Roughly speaking the eikonal resummation
of the t-channel pole in (C.12) amounts to the replacement (6.25)

M2PlLt
→
su
M2PlL(t− 4su/(M

, (C.13)
which remains finite as t → 0 and furthermore asymptotes to a constant at large s for fixed t. For
this approximation to work, the forward limit must be taken before decompactifying the z-direction
by L → ∞. In other words, one must ensure that t � 1/L2. Following the prescription of [21]
one can then further argue that the eikonal approximation will bear no effect on the contributions
to the scattering amplitude from the second term in (C.12). This can be easily understood from the
partial wave expansion of the finite terms in the amplitude (C.12). When expanded in terms of partial
waves, these only have contributions at low `. In contrast, the eikonal approximation is dominated
by the resummation of the large ` partial waves of the total amplitude and thus leaves specific small
` contributions unscathed. The validity of applying positivity bounds in 3d is critically discussed in
section 6, however assuming for now that they would be applicable, we would infer

Clearly this cannot be satisfied for any choice of partial UV completion parameters.
D Adding interactions to the UV theory
In this section we shall contemplate the possibility that our partial UV completion is to be blamed and
establish whether adding other operators that would otherwise be renormalizable in the absence of
gravity could help satisfying the compactified positivity bounds. Following this approach, we consider
cubic and quartic non-derivative operators that introduce additional φ, ψ interactions in our UV theory
(4.1) and discuss their implications for the positivity bounds applied to the χφ → χφ scattering
amplitude.

, (D.1)
where a, b are dimensionless constants and we have fixed the mass scale in front of the operators to
coincide with the mass of the heavy scalar, M . The new processes contributing to the χφ → χφ
scattering are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 and we define the corresponding interaction vertices as Vφ3 =
−iaM and Vψφ2 = −ibM .
D.1.1 The φ3 interaction
The presence of the φ3 interaction allows for two more one-loop scattering channels for the χφ→ χφ
scattering shown in Figs. (9a) and (9b). Together with the tree-level amplitude, the total scattering
amplitude due to the φ3 vertex is given by the sum:
Aφ3 = Zφ ×Atree,0 +Aφ3,1 +Aφ3,2 , (D.2)
where Zφ is the corresponding wavefunction normalization factor. Due to the presence of the light
loops we add the mass term − 1
2
m2φ2 to the total action. Let us emphasize that, when calculating the
amplitudes, the mass appearing in the propagators and in the vertices is this bare mass m. On the
other hand, when substituting the external momenta we use k21 = k
2
3 = −m2ph and u = −s− t+ 2m
2
ph
where mph is the physical mass. We determine the relation between the two below.
Renormalization. The φ3 interaction renormalizes the mass and the kinetic term of φ while the
cubic coupling aM does not get renormalized in 4d. Let us find the renormalized quantities up to
one-loop order. For this we first find the self-energy up to quadratic order in the coupling aM :

(D.18)
The analysis of the amplitude in (D.17) then continues in a manner very similar to section B.2.1 where
the cubic φψ2 interaction was analyzed in detail. As before we note that the amplitude has a branch
cut in the complex t-plane starting from the point where the denominator ∆ becomes negative. In
the expression for ∆ given above it is apparent that in the integration region the first two terms are
greater than zero and also xy ≥ 0 therefore the branch cut lies along the real positive values of t.
In particular, we find that there is a branch cut for t ≥ 4m2ph. As before when analyzing the φψ
2
interaction, we find that the first line of the one-loop amplitude Aφ3,1 has both a t-channel pole and
an s2 contribution. The second line is independent on s, t, but depends on the renormalization scale.
There is no s-dependence on the third line of the amplitude, moreover, it is finite and non-zero in
t→ 0 limit. Hence, it can be easily disregarded in the context of positivity bounds.

the s-dependence and the apparent one-loop contribution to the t-channel pole appear on the second

on the second line cancels out exactly: when the integrand on the second line is evaluated at t = 0 the
whole contribution in the square brackets equals to zero. Similarly, the term on the third line vanishes
once the integral is evaluated at t = 0. For the forward limit answer we thus have

D.1.2 The ψφ2 interaction
The addition of the ψφ2 interaction leads to two new diagrams contributing to the χφ→ χφ scattering,
shown in Figs. 10a and 10b. The analytic properties of the corresponding scattering amplitudes are
very similar to what was discussed for the QED interaction term −αMφψ2 discussed in section B.2.1.
We briefly analyze the amplitudes for the new processes below.
• The process in Fig. 10a. For this scattering process the amplitude reads
iAψφ2,1(s, t) =
∫
ddp

B(t) ≡
(d− 2)
d
t ,
∆ ≡ −M2(−1 + x+ y)− xyt .
(D.25)
Again this amplitude carries both a s2/t pole and a regular s2 contribution. Expanding the
integrand abound t = 0 we obtain

contribution to the scattering amplitude Aψφ2,1 is again negative.

Figure 11: The Feynman diagrams for the one-loop scattering processes contributing to χφ → χφ
from the additional quartic EFT operators in (D.31). Wiggly lines correspond to graviton propagators,
while bold lines correspond to the propagators of the heavy field ψ.
As for the s2/t pole appearing in both amplitudes calculated above, it vanishes once added to
the properly normalized tree-level scattering amplitude Atree = Zφ × Atree,0. Here the wavefunction
renormalization factor Zφ needs to be computed from the self-energy correction due to the ψφ
2 vertex.
As in all the previous cases we then find that the t-pole cancels leaving only the original pole due to
the tree-level graviton exchange

ψ as

, (D.31)
where λ,$ are dimensionless couplings. These give new interaction vertices Vφ4 = −iλ and Vψ2φ2 =
−i$ allowing for new processes contributing to the χφ→ χφ scattering, shown in Fig. 11.
D.2.1 The φ4 interaction
The scattering amplitude for the process in Fig. 11a involves a loop of the light field φ, so we regularize
it by adding a mass term − 1
2
m2φ2. The amplitude can then be written as
iAφ4(s, t) =

where N is the symmetry factor of the diagram. After the usual manipulations we find

This amplitude only depends on t and thus does not contribute to the positivity bounds (2.6). More-
over, it has a branch cut for t ≥ 4m2, but does not have a t-pole. It is thus finite in the forward
limit.

D.2.2 The ψ2φ2 interaction
The quartic ψ2φ2 interaction leads to an additional scattering process depicted in Fig. 11b. Since this
process only contains a heavy loop we can again set m = 0. The scattering amplitude is found to be
iAψ2φ2(s, t) =

As for the φ4 vertex, this amplitude is finite at t = 0 and does not affect the positivity bounds. As
expected, it has a branch cut for t ≥ 4M2.
E Renormalizable spectator field interactions
An obvious way of deforming the UV completion in (4.1) would be to introduce non-derivative12
interactions between the spectator χ and ψ. Trying to be as minimalistic as possible let us consider
LpUV,3 =

, (E.1)
where we have only added the interaction −%Mχψ2 leading to a new vertex Vχψ2 = −2i%M . This
introduces two new diagrams contributing to the χφ → χφ scattering shown in Figs. 12a and 12b.
Note that as in (3.3) this new interaction would also introduce new terms like %
2
M2
Rµν∂µχ∂νχ in the
IR theory. We shall not work out the IR action explicitly here since it is equivalent to working at the
level of scattering amplitudes.
• The first diagram in Fig. 12a is entirely analogous to the diagram shown in Fig. 6b and the
amplitude reads
iAχψ2(s, t) =
∫
ddp

(E.2)
Although slightly different in details the final result for the finite s2 contribution gives again the
second equality in (B.19) with α↔ % thus leading to the same negative contribution
Aχψ2, s2(s, t) = −
%2s2
90(4π)2M2M2Pl
+ . . . . (E.3)
12One could in principle also introduce non-derivative interactions directly between the light scalars χ and φ. The
possible cubic operators are φχ2 and χφ2 with the corresponding additional scattering processes shown in Figs. 13
and 14. The presence of light χ and φ loops in some of these diagrams will again require that we introduce a small
non-zero masses for χ and φ to regulate the amplitude. All these diagrams have been computed earlier and always
give negative s2 contribution to the total amplitude. In turn, as was shown in subsection D.2 quartic non-derivative
interactions do not depend on s.

(E.4)
– 42 –
where one also has to add the contributions from the crossed diagrams, similarly as was done in
appendix A. For the specific diagram in Fig. 12b, the various denominators can be combined by
introducing three Feynman parameters x, y, z leading to
iAbox(s, t) =
16α2%2M4
4
∫
ddp
(2π)d
∫
R
3! dx dy dz
[k2 + ∆]4
,
where ∆ ≡M2 + sz(x+ y+ z− 1)− txy and the factor 1/4 appears due to the symmetry of the
diagram; the integration region is R = {x, y, z ∈ R |x, y, z ≥ 0, x+ y + z ≤ 1}. The momentum
integral can be easily taken using (B.2) leaving at t = 0
Abox(s, t) =
3α2%2M2
4π2
∫
R
dxdy dz z2(−1 + x+ y + z)2 × s2 +O(t0) . (E.5)
Since in the integration region R the integrand is positive, so is the integral (and equal to
1/1260) and so is the contribution to the s2 term in the scattering amplitude. Hence, the positive
contribution of the box diagram could naively be used to cancel the negative s2 contributions
coming from the processes shown in Figs. 6b and 12a. However, the situation here is in fact
very similar to what we have seen earlier in section 3 when discussing the positivity bounds (3.8)
obtained from the UV theory in (3.2). Also here the positive contribution coming from the loop
diagram in Fig. 12b can be subtracted by the procedure of improved positivity bounds. As a
result the negative gravitational s2 contributions to the scattering amplitude remain and the
improved positivity bounds again lead to an inconsistency.
We thus conclude that none of the possible renormalizable interactions of the spectator field satisfy
the new positivity bounds.

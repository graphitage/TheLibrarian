We propose two models where a U(1) Peccei-Quinn global symmetry
arises accidentally and is respected up to high-dimensional operators,
so that the axion solution to the strong CP problem is successful even
in the presence of Planck-suppressed operators. One model is SU(N )
gauge interactions with fermions in the fundamental and a scalar in
the symmetric. The axion arises from spontaneous symmetry break-
ing to SO(N ), that confines at a lower energy scale. Axion quality
in the model needs N >∼ 10. SO bound states and possibly monopoles
provide extra Dark Matter candidates beyond the axion. In the second
model the scalar is in the anti-symmetric: SU(N ) broken to Sp(N )
needs even N >∼ 20. The cosmological DM abundance, consisting of
axions and/or super-heavy relics, can be reproduced if the PQ sym-
metry is broken before inflation (Boltzmann-suppressed production of
super-heavy relics) or after (super-heavy relics in thermal equilibrium
get partially diluted by dark glue-ball decays).

1 Introduction
The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem [1, 2] has a problematic aspect:
it relies on a global U(1)PQ symmetry which, although broken at low energy by the QCD
anomaly, must be an extremely good symmetry of high-energy physics. This issue is known as
the PQ quality problem [3–8]. Global symmetries are believed not to be fundamental, and arise
as accidental symmetries e.g. in gauge theories. Well known examples are baryon and lepton
numbers in the Standard Model (SM). Conceptually, there are two steps in the formulation of
the problem:
i) the U(1)PQ should arise accidentally in a renormalizable Lagrangian;
ii) approximating higher-energy physics as non-renormalizable operators suppressed by some
scale ΛUV, the U(1)PQ should be preserved by operators with dimension up to d ∼ 9
assuming ΛUV ∼MPl and an axion decay constant fa & 109 GeV.
The bound becomes stronger for higher fa and lower ΛUV. Indeed, it comes from requiring that
the energy density due to UV sources of U(1)PQ breaking is about 10
−10
times smaller than

the energy density of the QCD axion potential(

QCD, (1)
so that the induced axion vacuum expectation value (VEV) is 〈a〉/fa . 10−10, within the
neutron electric dipole moment bound.
In string models one expects towers of new states below or around the Planck scale, that
make manifest the PQ-quality problem. The PQ-quality problem is not present in different
theories with no states heavier than fa that mediate PQ-breaking operators, so that the effective
operators assumed in eq. (1) are absent.
Furthermore, it is believed that gravity violates global symmetries, based on semi-classical
arguments related to black holes and Hawking radiation. In scenarios in which Einstein gravity
is minimally coupled to the axion field, non-conservation of the PQ global charge arises from
non-perturbative effects described by Euclidean wormholes. These effects are calculable to some
extent and correct the axion potential as [9–13]
∼M4Ple−Swh cos (a+ δ) , (2)
where Swh ∼ MPl/fa is the wormhole action and δ is a generic displacement due to the fact
that the gravity contribution does not need to be aligned to the low-energy QCD contribution.
Although exponentially suppressed, the contribution in eq. (2) poses a problem for the PQ
solution for fa & 6 10
16
GeV.
Eq. (2) holds if gravity is well described by the Einstein term at Planckian energies. An
alternative possibility is that gravity gets modified at lower energies where it is still weakly
coupled so that it remains weakly coupled, making non-perturbative effects irrelevant. This
for example arises in 4-derivative gravity, a renormalizable theory that allows for accidental
global symmetries not broken by higher dimensional operators and negligibly broken by non-
perturbative gravitational effects [14]. Such theory, however, contains potentially problematic
negative kinetic energy at the classical level (see e.g. [15]).
We here assume that the PQ-quality problem is a real problem and address it by devising a
simple gauge dynamics along the lines of [16,17] that gives an accidental global PQ symmetry
respected by operators up to large enough dimension. Section 3 describes a model based on
a gauge group SU(N ) spontaneously broken to Sp(N ) by a scalar S in the anti-symmetric
representation in the presence of fermions in the fundamental, as listed in table 1. The PQ
symmetry is broken by the N /2-dimensional local operator
√
detS. Section 4 considers a
similar model where a scalar S in the symmetric breaks SU(N )→ SO(N ), and the first PQ-
breaking operator is the N -dimensional operator detS. Both models can provide extra Dark
Matter (DM) candidates beyond the axion. Section 2 outlines some common features of the
two models. Section 3 describes the model with a scalar in the anti-symmetric, and section 4
the model with a scalar in the symmetric. Conclusions are given in section 5.

in the symmetric (section 4) two-index representation. The heavy quarks QL,QR and leptons
LL,LR are Weyl doublets. If L have vanishing hypercharge, their bound states could become
acceptable DM candidates and there is no difference between LL and LR.
2 Outline of the models
We consider a gauge group GSM ⊗ SU(N ), with a new scalar S in the two-index symmetric
or anti-symmetric representation of SU(N ), and new left-handed chiral Weyl fermions charged
under SU(N ) as listed in table 1: one Q dubbed ‘quark’ because in the fundamental of color,
and three L dubbed ‘leptons’ because uncolored. Three L are needed in order to avoid gauge
anomalies and to obtain the desired PQ anomalies. The three L could be 1 ⊕ 2 or 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 1
under SU(2)L; as the choice does not make a big difference we assume the latter possibility and
that all 3 leptons have the same hypercharge YL, for the moment left unspecified and possibly
vanishing. Irrespectively of their hypercharges, the fermions Q and L are chiral: their mass
terms are forbidden by gauge invariance for all values of the hypercharges YQ and YL.
As discussed in the next sections, the renormalizable theory contains three accidental global
U(1) symmetries: the one acting as a phase rotation of the scalar S will be the PQ symmetry.
It gets spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar S, that also breaks
SU(N ) to either Sp(N ) (scalar in the anti-symmetric, studied in section 3) or to SO(N )
(scalar in the symmetric, studied in section 4). As a result the fermions Q and L acquire mass
from Yukawa couplings to S and the phase of S becomes the axion. In both models all gauge
anomalies vanish, and U(1)PQ has the desired anomalies:
• There is a non-vanishing U(1)PQ SU(3)2c anomaly: to achieve this we introduced the
fermions L and Q in two different representations of color. We chose the simplest ones
(singlet and triplet), although different models using more complicated representations of
color are possible.
• The U(1)PQ U(1)2Y anomaly is proportional to Y 2Q − Y 2L and contributes to the axion-
photon coupling.
4
• We introduced the appropriate number of leptons L such that the U(1)PQ SU(N )2 anomaly
vanishes: then the axion relaxes the SU(3)c θ term, rather than the one of the extra gauge
group SU(N ).
A similar model based on SU(N )L× SU(N )R gauge dynamics broken by a scalar transforming
in the bi-fundamental down to SU(N )L+R was considered in [16], which shares similarities with
the two models presented here. Differently from [16], we assign non-zero SM hypercharges to
the exotic fermions and show that it is possible to get rid of dangerous colored relics. This
enlarges the parameter space of the model also to the case where the PQ is broken after inflation
and opens the possibility of having extra DM candidates in the form of Sp/SO bound states.
3 Antisymmetric scalar that breaks SU(N )→ Sp(N )
We assume even N , as for odd N symmetry breaking is slightly different and the axion is eaten
by a vector [17]. If N > 8 the most generic renormalizable Lagrangian is
L = LSM + Lkin + LYuk − V (S). (3)

where H is the SM Higgs doublet. If YL 6= 0 without loss of generality we can rotate to a
basis where the Yukawa matrix yL is diagonal, diag(yL1 , yL2 , yL3), with real positive entries. If
YL = 0 the matrix yL is anti-symmetric and can be rotated to diag(yL1 , yL2 , yL3)⊗ � where � is
the 2× 2 antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor.
Accidental symmetries
The gauge-covariant kinetic terms are invariant under phase rotations of each field. In the
presence of the Yukawa and potential couplings the theory remains accidentally invariant under
U(1)Q ⊗ U(1)L1,2,3 ⊗ U(1)PQ (5)
where U(1)Q and U(1)Li are the baryon and lepton numbers of Q and Li according to which
QL and QR have the opposite charge (similarly for leptons), while S is uncharged. The U(1)PQ
5
symmetry acting on S can be identified (a posteriori) as a PQ symmetry and it acts as shown
in table 1, where we chose a convenient basis. The accidental flavour symmetry rotates with
opposite phases the two L fields involved in each mass term: for YL 6= 0 mass terms involve
LLLR pairs, while for YL = 0 a similar pair structure arises at renormalizable level thanks to
the anti-symmetry of the mass matrix.
Landau poles
We constrain the field content and parameters of the model by requiring that its couplings do
not hit Landau poles below the Planck scale. The SU(N ) gauge coupling g is asymptotically
free. Above the masses mQ,mL of the new fermions, the one-loop beta functions of the strong

3.1 Symmetry breaking and perturbative spectrum
In a range of potential parameters, the scalar S acquires vacuum expectation value 〈S〉 = wγN
where γN = 1N/2 ⊗ � is the invariant tensor under symplectic transformations. This breaks
SU(N )⊗U(1)PQ to Sp(N ) leaving one axion and giving mass to all new fermions. Following [17]
for even N the scalar field is conveniently parametrised as

where T̃

are the SU(N ) generators such that γN T̃ b is anti-symmetric (which satisfy the con-
dition T̃

perturbative level is:
• N (N + 1)/2 massless vectors Aa in the adjoint of Sp(N );
• N (N − 1)/2 − 1 vectors Wb in the traceless anti-symmetric of Sp(N ), that acquire a

• The massless scalar a, singlet under Sp(N ). In view of the U(1)PQ SU(3)2c anomaly it
can be called axion and, as shown below, its decay constant will be fa = w/

axion will get a mass because of the QCD anomaly;

• The scalar s singlet under Sp(N ). If symmetry breaking arises through the Coleman-

s = 24(NλS + λ′S)w2;
• N (N − 1)/2 − 1 scalars s̃b with squared mass M2s̃ = 8(NλS + 3λ′S)w2, in the traceless
anti-symmetric of Sp(N );
• One colored Dirac quark ΨQ = (γNQL, Q̄R)T with massMQ = yQw in the anti-fundamental
of Sp(N ) charged under the accidental global U(1)Q;
• Three Dirac leptons with masses MLi = y

Lw in the fundamental of Sp(N ) and charged
under the accidental global U(1)Li . Dirac fermions are constructed pairing the Weyl
fermions involved in each mass term e.g. Ψ
i
L = (γNLiL, L̄iR) if YL 6= 0.
The fermions are perturbatively stable thanks to the unbroken global U(1)Q,Li symmetries
discussed in eq. (5).

, (8)
where αDC = g
2
/4π and we took into account only the running due to the gauge bosons A. We
normalise the Dynkin index of SU(N ) as S2 = 1/2 for the fundamental. In the confined phase,
the baryons containing fermions (�NW(N−2)/2QQ, �NW(N−2)/2LL and �NW(N−2)/2QL, with �N
denoting the N -dimensional Levi-Civita tensor) decay into lighter mesons QγNQ, LγNL and
QL. Depending on the constituent masses mQ and mL, 2 or 3 of such mesons are stable because
of the accidental fermion-number symmetries U(1)Q and U(1)L present at the renormalizable
level,
1
we will later discuss how the situation changes at the non-renormalizable level.
3.3 Axion effective Lagrangian
Under a U(1)PQ rotation with angle α the fields transform as
a→ a+ α
√
N /2w, Q → e+iα/2Q, Li → e−iα/2Li.
1
The new sector also respects a C symmetry [17] defined as S → S∗, Dµ → D∗µ, F → iγ2F†, with F denoting
the various fermions. On the Sp(N ) bosonic multiplets, C acts as follows
s→ s, a→ −a, s̃→ −γN s̃γN , A → −γNAγN , W → γNWγN . (9)
The colored fermions Q relate this symmetry to the SM via QCD, so that C (combined with parity) extends
the usual charge-parity conjugation CP, under which the axion is odd, as it should.

as gaγ = αemCaγ/(2πfa) in terms of the dimension-less coupling [18–20]
Caγ = 6(Y

Q − Y 2L )− 1.92(4). (12)
Axion Domain Walls
The QCD anomaly breaks U(1)PQ → ZN , since the 2πfa-periodic axion potential has N
degenerate minima when the axion field is varied in its angular domain a ∈ [0, 2π)
√
N /2w =
[0, 2π)N fa. However, the ZN action can be embedded in the SU(N ) center, thus making the
axion minima gauge equivalent. This avoids the formation of axion domain walls at the QCD
phase transition, and solves the axion domain wall problem along the lines of [21, 16].
3.4 Higher dimensional operators
So far we considered the renormalizable theory. As anticipated, the relevance of the present
model consists in the fact that the PQ symmetry arises accidentally at the renormalizable
level and can remain good enough even in the presence of possible non-renormalizable opera-
tors. In this section we study how effective operators can break accidental symmetries, hence
contributing to the axion potential and to the decay of heavy relics.
PQ-breaking operators
We defined the PQ symmetry such that the PQ charge of any field is proportional to its N -
ality (number of lower indices minus number of higher indices). This means that operators
containing one �N tensor of SU(N ) break the PQ symmetry, while it is preserved by all other
operators, such as the renormalizable Yukawa couplings of eq. (4b), or the dimension-7 operator
(qRQL)S∗(q′RQL).
8
We then search for the lowest-dimensional operator containing one �N tensor. This is
built contracting with scalars S, as replacing one SIJ with two fermions QI or L̄I increases
the dimension of the operator. The lowest dimensional operator that explicitly breaks the
accidental PQ symmetry is the Pfaffian, with dimension N /2
Pf S =
√
detS = �I1I2...IN−1INN SI1I2 . . .SIN−1IN . (13)
Assuming that new physics generates such operator with coefficient suppressed by some scale
ΛUV, its contribution to the axion potential originates from

Pf S + h.c., (14)
where ϕ is a generic CP-violating phase. Inserting Pf S = wN/2eia/2fa + · · · the axion potential

Note that this bound holds even if the new physics respects CP, ϕ = 0, as the operator would
not relax the axion to the field value that cancels CP violation at low energy and hence it
would not cancel the θ̄ term. If ΛUV ∼ MPl, the phenomenological bound fa & 1011 GeV for
PQ symmetry broken after inflation requires N & 24. If, instead, the PQ symmetry is broken
before inflation fa can be as low as 10
9
GeV and then N & 20 suffices. In our numerical plots
we will assume for definiteness a Planckian cut-off. If instead ΛUV ≈ 2×1016 GeV (as motivated
e.g. by supersymmetric unification) one needs N & 24 for fa & 109 GeV.
Q-decay operators
Furthermore, gauge invariance allows dimension 6 operators such as
(qRQIL)(eRLI), (qRQIR)(q′RLI), (17)
(where qR = (uR, dR) and eR are left-handed Weyl spinors, SU(2)L-singlet SM quarks and
leptons) that conserve the PQ symmetry and break the other accidental global U(1)’s as
U(1)Q ⊗ U(1)L → U(1)Q−L (18)
9
such that only the lightest state containing Q and/or L is stable. Assuming that Q is heavier
than L, heavier Sp bound states containing Q decay with rate [22]

Furthermore we neglect the possibility that Q decays while dominating the energy density of
the universe and thereby providing extra reheating and dilution.
LL-decay operators
The Sp mesons LγNL with mass
MLL ∼ max(Λ Sp, 2yLw), (21)
are possibly stable but are charged if YL 6= 0. We avoid heavy charged relics assuming
YL = 0 and YQ = {−
1
3
,
2
3
,−4
3
}. (22)
For YL = 0 the Sp mesons are kept stable only by the accidental flavour symmetry that arises
at renormalizable level and that gets broken if dimension-6 operators such as LiSS†SLj have
a different flavour structure. One then expects that LγNL mesons decay fast, leaving no relics
despite that L is stable. We will however also mention the alternative possibility that LγNL is
an acceptable DM candidate with τLL>∼ 10
26
sec, given that flavour couplings might be small
and not approximated by a single scale ΛUV.
The bounds related to Landau poles and higher-dimensional operators (from BBN and PQ
quality) are plotted in fig. 1, which shows that they can all be simultaneously satisfied for
N >∼ 24 and physically acceptable values of the axion decay constant fa.
Axion-photon coupling predictions
Requiring that the colored exotic states Q decay fast enough to avoid problems with cosmology
allows to fix their hypercharges and in turn to predict the axion-photon coupling, following a
similar strategy as in the case of KSVZ axions [24, 25]. In particular, in fig. 2 we show the
predictions for the dimension-less axion-photon coupling in eq. (12) according to the values of

We assumed yQ = 1 = 2yL and non-renormalizable operators suppressed by ΛUV ≈MPl (darker
regions) or MGUT ≈ 2 1016 GeV (lighter regions). Left: model with a scalar in the anti-
symmetric. Right: model with a scalar in the anti-symmetric. The stars indicate the models

the hypercharges in eq. (22). Current limits (full lines) and projected ones (dashed lines) from
axion experiments are displayed as well. It should be noted that most of those experiments
(apart for CAST, IAXO and ALPS-II) assume that the axion comprises the 100% of DM.
Consequently their sensitivity is diluted as Ωa/ΩDM, if the axion is only a fraction of the whole
DM. Hence, we next study the cosmology and the composition of the DM abundance.
3.5 Cosmology and Dark Matter
The model contains two DM candidates: the axion condensate and possibly the LγNL meson
if YL = 0. The reheating temperature after inflation is TRH ∼
√
MPlHinfl if reheating happens
instantaneously, or TRH ∼
√
MPlΓinfl otherwise. Qualitatively different cosmological histories
arise depending on whether TRH is high enough so that the PQ symmetry is restored after
inflation.

3.5.1 PQ broken before inflation, TRH <∼ fa

Hubble rate during inflation must be smaller than

in order to avoid excessive axion iso-curvature fluctuations during inflation (see e.g. section 3.5
of [27]). This implies an upper bound on TRH, that anyhow must be smaller than fa under the
present assumptions.
All the heavy stable relics including topological defects (strings from PQ breaking) get
diluted during the inflationary expansion. The abundance of the DM candidates is estimated
as follows:
• The axion DM abundance produced through the misalignment mechanism can be ana-
lytically approximated as [27]

that it is produced thermally.

In fig. 3a we show the parameter space of the model for some representative benchmark values.
We select a high N = 26 such that DM can be composed solely by axions: in view of eq. (24)
this happens along the vertical line in fig. 3. More likely LL are unstable and the value of yL
is irrelevant. We assumed a small yL = 10
−3
such that, if LL is stable, a second DM branch
appears in fig. 3a in which DM is composed by mesons via thermal production. The transition
between eq. (25) and eq. (26) gives rise to the discontinuity at TRH ∼ ΛSp in fig. 3a.
3.5.2 PQ broken after inflation, TRH >∼ fa
We here consider the alternative situation where the reheating temperature is high enough that
the PQ symmetry is restored after inflation and all the new states predicted by the model
thermalise.
Demanding that axions do not exceed the cosmological DM density gives the bound fa <
2.0 × 1011 GeV for the average initial misalignment angle θin = 2.2. The latter numerical
result (more precise than eq. (24)) is obtained by tracking the temperature dependence of
the topological susceptibility via lattice QCD simulations [28]. If the PQ symmetry is broken
after inflation, topological defects (strings and domain walls) add up to the total axion relic
density. The contribution of would-be disastrous axion domain walls to the energy density is
avoided thanks to the mechanism outlined at the end of section 3.3, while that of axion strings
is relevant, but difficult to be estimated (see e.g. [29]). We neglect it here for simplicity, also
because a complete consensus on their importance has not been achieved yet in the literature.
However, recent developments indicate that they would strengthen the upper bound on fa by
more than one order of magnitude [30].
On the other hand, the possibly stable DM candidate LγNL risks being over-abundant. Its
thermal relic abundance, YLL ∼ 1/TdecMPlσann with σann ∼ 1/Λ2Sp and Tdec ∼ Λ Sp (section
2.3 of [31] contains an extended discussion), is over-abundant if its mass MLL is above than
100 TeV, the critical value above which even strongly-coupled freeze-out leaves too much DM.
A LγNL lighter than 100 TeV needs a very small yL and ΛSp.

Figure 3: Parameter space of the SU(26) model assuming YL = 0, YQ = −1/3, and yQ =
1. We chose a large N such that the cosmological DM abundance is reproduced along the
red/green boundary (the dashed curve shows how this boundary would change if, in addition
to the axion, a cosmologically stable LL meson with yL = 10−3 contributes to DM; otherwise
the same plots apply for any yL � yQ). The right red region is disfavoured by the PQ quality
arguments in eq. (16). Left: assuming that the PQ symmetry is broken before inflation with

assuming that TRH >∼ fa, i.e. PQ-breaking after inflation. The left white region is excluded
because colored relics decay after BBN (τQ > 0.1 sec).
Furthermore, the colored relics and the glue-balls of Sp(N ) must decay before BBN, but
their decay can be slow enough so that they substantially reheat the universe. Dark glue-balls
decays dilute all relics containing Q and L heavy fermions (while the axion density is still a
cosmological constant and hence is not diluted), allowing to get a multi-component LγNL plus
axion abundance that matches the DM relic density. We anyhow demand that colored relics
decay before BBN, which implies the bound found in eq. (20).

Dark glue-balls with mass MDG ≈ 7Λ Sp can decay into axions and SM particles through
the Feynman diagrams in fig. 4. The rates are estimated as follows:

The most important channels are (29) and (30) for yL � 1, while (30) dominates if yL ∼ 1.
The parameter space is plotted in fig. 3b: we see that regions exist where all constraints are
satisfied, the axion quality is good, and the DM cosmological abundance is reproduced either
through axions or through dark mesons (if stable), or both.
4 Symmetric scalar that breaks SU(N )→ SO(N )
We next consider a different but similar model: the scalar is now in the symmetric representation
and spontaneously breaks the SU(N ) gauge group to SO(N ). We avoid repeating the many
aspects of the model which remain similar to those in section 3 and highlight the key differences.
If N > 4 the most generic renormalizable Lagrangian has the same form as in eq.s (3) and
(4). The Yukawa matrix yL is now symmetric and can be rotated to a basis where it is diagonal
with real positive entries. We again require that couplings do not hit Landau poles below the
Planck scale; SM couplings run as in the previous model, giving the same constraints.
Accidental symmetries
The situation is similar to the model of section 3, but with two differences.
First, in both models the SU(N ) theory is accidentally invariant under a reflection, which
we dub U-parity [17], of any of the N equivalent directions in group space. U-parity is obtained
by flipping the sign of any color, for example the 1st one. This flips the signs of those generators
with an 1I entry, preserving the SU(N ) Lie algebra, such that U parity acts on components of
vectors in the adjoint and of other multiplets as
GJI
PU→ (−1)δ1I+δ1JGJI , QI
PU→ (−1)δ1IQI , LI
PU→ (−1)δ1ILI , SIJ
PU→ (−1)δ1I+δ1JSIJ
(32)
having written the SU(N ) vectors as GIJ = GA(TA)IJ . We ignored U-parity when discussing
the SU(N ) → Sp(N ) breaking in the previous section, because U-parity was broken by 〈S〉.
In the present model, instead, U-parity is preserved when SU(N ) is spontaneously broken by
〈S〉 = w1N to SO(N ). As a result, SO(N ) confinement produces dark baryons odd under
U-parity: those built contracting constituents with one �N . The lightest of such baryons is a
stable DM candidate.
The U(1)PQ symmetry again acts as shown in table 1. If YL 6= 0 all accidental global
symmetries are the same as in the previous model, eq. (5). The second difference arises if YL = 0:
leptons now acquire a Majorana mass, so U(1)L lepton number gets replaced by a Z2 that acts
as lepton parity Li → −Li. The accidental global symmetries become U(1)Q ⊗ Z2 ⊗ U(1)PQ.
16
4.1 Symmetry breaking and perturbative spectrum
In a range of potential parameters, the scalar S acquires vacuum expectation value 〈S〉 = w1N .
This breaks SU(N ) ⊗ U(1)PQ to SO(N ) leaving one axion and giving mass to all fermions.
Following [17] the scalar field is conveniently parametrised as

where T

real are the real (symmetric) generators of SU(N ) in the fundamental representation,
while s, s̃, ã, a are canonically normalized fields. The mass spectrum at the perturbative level
is:
• N (N − 1)/2 massless vectors Aa in the adjoint of SO(N ).

• One colored Dirac quark ΨQ = (QL, Q̄R)T with mass MQ = yQw in the fundamental

• Three Dirac leptons ΨiL = (LiL, L̄iR)T with masses MLi = y

The quarks Q are perturbatively stable thanks to the accidental global U(1)Q while the leptons
Li are stable thanks to the global U(1)Li (if YL 6= 0) or the discrete Z2 symmetries (if YL = 0).
4.2 Confinement and bound states
The SO(N ) gauge dynamics confines at the energy scale
ΛSO ≈ fa exp

. (34)
17
The theory contains a CP parity that extends the QCD CP parity analogously to what discussed
in footnote 1. SO(N ) confinement leads to bound states, and we are interested in the possibly
stable states. These are the SO baryons formed contracting constituents with an anti-symmetric
�N tensor of SO(N ), taking into account that group theory allows SO gluons to be constituents.
• IfN is even the lightest baryon is the 0-ball �NAN/2 made of SO gluons only, stable thanks
to U-parity (see e.g. [17]). On the other hand, the lighter baryons containing fermions
�NA(N−2)/2QQ, �NA(N−2)/2LL, �NA(N−2)/2QL (35)
can decay respecting U-parity into the 0-ball plus the corresponding lighter mesons QQ,
LL, QL. Such mesons are stable in the limit of exact U(1)Q,L symmetries.
• If N is odd the lightest baryons contain one fermion (and thereby dubbed 1-ball)
�NA(N−1)/2Q, �NA(N−1)/2L (36)
are stable if the fermion Q and/or L is stable.
4.3 Higher dimensional operators
Unlike in the model with an anti-symmetric discussed as in section 3.4, in the present model
with a symmetric the lowest dimensional operator that breaks the PQ symmetry is detS at
dimension N . PQ quality now demands a weaker bound on fa,

Demanding again τQ < 0.1 sec in order to avoid problems with BBN we derive a bound on fa
a factor of 2 stronger than in eq. (20). Assuming that Q decays, the stable relics are:
if YL 6= 0 if YL = 0
if N is odd �NA(N−1)/2L and LL �NA(N−1)/2L
if N is even �NAN/2 and LL �NAN/2
. (38)
YL = 0 is needed to have no charged relics.
The interplay between Landau pole, BBN and PQ-quality constraints is displayed in fig. 1b,
while for the given values of YQ = {−13 ,

4.4 SU(N )/ SO(N ) monopoles?
A qualitatively new feature of the SU(N )→ SO(N ) model is the presence of an unusual type of
magnetic monopoles. Indeed, while the model of section 3 had a trivial second homotopy group
π2( SU(N )/ Sp(N )) = 0, in the present model π2( SU(N )/ SO(N )) = Z2 is non-trivial and
allows for topologically stable Z2 monopoles [34] with mass Mmon ≈ MW/αDC. Z2 monopoles
differ from the well known monopoles carrying a U(1) magnetic charge by the fact that their
charge is discrete, modulo 2, so that two Z2 monopole annihilate. Their semi-classical limit
was constructed in [34–36]. It was later realised that such monopoles fill multiplets under an
emerging magnetic gauge group: in the present theory monopoles likely fill a spinorial of a dual
Spin(N ) [37,38]. Monopoles and their vectors are massless in theories where super-symmetries
allow to reliably compute gauge dynamics beyond the semi-classical approximation [39,38], but
not in the present theory.
Furthermore, in our theory SO(N ) is unbroken and (most likely) confines at a lower scale
ΛSO. Thereby SO(N ) magnetic fields cannot reach infinity, casting doubts on the topological
argument for monopole stability. Indeed, it is believed that SO(N ) confinement corresponds,
in the dual theory, to full Higgsing of Spin(N ) [38], so that monopoles can mix with electric
states and decay. We will then study cosmology assuming no stable monopoles.
However, as non-perturbative gauge dynamics is not firmly known, we also consider the
opposite, less likely, possibility of stable monopoles. Then monopoles contribute to the DM
density, with the abundance estimated in the rest of this section. Monopoles form at the
SU(N )→ SO(N ) cosmological phase transition. As long as MW , fa � ΛSO the short-distance
dynamics of monopole formation is not affected by SO(N ) confinement and the estimates for
cosmological monopole production via the Kibble mechanism [40] apply. If the SU(N ) →
SO(N ) phase transition is of second order, the Kibble-Zurek estimate [41,42] is

where Tc ≈MW is the critical temperature of the phase transition and ν is the related critical
exponent (ν = 1/2 at classical level).
If instead the transition is of first order, the Kibble estimate is enhanced by a logarithmic
factor due to the process of bubble nucleation [43]:

where gSM ≈ 100 is the number of SM degrees of freedom. Finally, the monopole abundance gets
diluted by monopole annihilations and possibly by inflation (if PQ is broken before inflation)
or by dark glue-ball decays (if PQ is broken after inflation).
19
4.5 Cosmology and Dark Matter
DM is composed by axions, by the 0-ball �AN/2 (for even N ) or the 1-ball �A(N−1)/2L (for odd
N and YL = 0), and possibly by monopoles (if stable). As in the Sp model, we consider the
two possible cases.
4.5.1 PQ broken before inflation, TRH <∼ fa
Inflation dilutes all relics, so cosmology is similar to what discussed in section 3.5.1 for the
Sp model. Sp mesons containing 2L get replaced by SO bound states containing 0L or 1L.
Their relic abundance is again estimated assuming that such states have a non-perturbative
annihilation cross section of order 1/Λ
2
SO. Fig. 5a considers the case of even N = 14, showing
that there are regions where all constraints are satisfied and the cosmological abundance re-
produced, as combinations of axions and heavy relics.
2
For odd N the relics containing 1L can
be heavier than ΛSO, and thereby have a smaller abundance produced by thermal scatterings
after inflation. Nevertheless, one can again find regions where all constraints are satisfied.
4.5.2 PQ broken after inflation, TRH >∼ fa
Relics are now not diluted by inflation. Still, abundances at desired level are obtained taking
into account that they annihilate with cross section σann ∼ 100/Λ2SO and that glue-balls can
decay slowly, reheating the lighter particles and diluting the heavier relics. We anyhow demand
that Q relics decay before BBN, finding the extra bound fa & 1011 GeV in fig. 5b. Axions and
glue-balls behave as in section 3.5.2, except that now gDG = N (N − 1) and the scalon-glue-
ball effective Lagrangian becomes −(7N + 10)αDC(Aµν)2s/8πw. Fig. 5b shows that regions
exist where all constraints are satisfied, the axion quality is good and the cosmological DM
abundance reproduced. We here considered even N = 14; similar results are found for odd N .
So far we assumed that monopoles decay. As this is not firmly established, we also consider
the possibility that stable monopoles contribute to the DM abundance. Assuming the Kibble-
Zurek estimate (dashed curve) we find that monopoles tend to be too much abundant in the
allowed regions. This can be partially avoided by estimated monopole annihilations (dot-dashed
curve).
2
If ΛSO is smaller than TRH a thermal-equilibrium population of dark gluons is present, that later dilutes
the 0-ball number density, when it dominates the energy density of the Universe in the form of long-lived dark
glueballs. Hence, 0-balls are under-abundant for ΛSO . TRH.

symmetric, assuming yQ = 1, yL = 0.1, YL = 0, YQ = −1/3. DM is composed by axions and 0-
balls. The relic DM abundance is reproduced along the boundaries between the red/green regions.
White (gray) regions are excluded because Q (dark glue-balls) decay after BBN. The region at
large fa is disfavoured by poor PQ quality, eq. (37). Left: we assume PQ-breaking before
inflation with TRH = 10
7
GeV� fa. The axion DM abundance is computed for θin = 1. Right:
PQ-breaking after inflation. We assumed that monopoles decay; otherwise they contribute as
well to the DM density and the curve along which the DM abundance is reproduced becomes the
dashed curve (Kibble-Zurek estimate) or the dot-dashed curve (Kibble-Zurek plus an estimate
of monopole annihilations).
5 Conclusions
We proposed two simple models that provide a high-quality accidental PQ symmetry. The
models are based on SU(N ) gauge dynamics spontaneously broken to either Sp(N ) or SO(N )
by a scalar S in the anti-symmetric or symmetric and heavy quarks and leptons in the fun-
damental, as summarized in table 1. The PQ symmetry acts as a phase rotation of S and
is only broken by operators involving the SU(N ) anti-symmetric invariant tensor with N in-
dices. If S is symmetric the lowest-dimensional operator that breaks the PQ symmetry is detS
with dimension N . If S is anti-symmetric the lowest-dimensional operator that breaks the PQ
symmetry is Pf S =
√
detS with dimension N /2. A high-quality PQ symmetry is thereby ob-
tained for large enough N . Putting together constraints of theoretical type (PQ quality and no
sub-Planckian Landau poles, see fig. 1) and of phenomenological type (colored relics decaying
before BBN, cosmological DM density), the models are viable if N >∼ 12 (for the symmetric) or
21
N >∼ 24 (for the anti-symmetric).
The models contain extra accidental symmetries that can lead to heavy relics. Generic
non-renormalizable operators break some accidental symmetries. With an appropriate choice
of heavy fermion hypercharges and masses, heavy quarks decay before BBN into heavy leptons,
that form bound states together with dark vectors when the unbroken color group (SO or Sp)
confines at some scale Λ. Depending on the model, such bound states either decay or leave
cosmologically stable relics that provide extra DM candidates beyond the axion.
If the PQ symmetry is broken before inflation, extra relics get diluted away and are only
marginally produced at reheating, so that DM candidates can have the desired abundance.
If the PQ symmetry is broken after inflation, thermal relics of super-heavy particles are
typically over-abundant. This is not necessarily a problem, as the models under consideration
contain dark glue-balls that decay mildly slowly and can thereby partially dilute the heavier
relics (while the axion density, still in the form of vacuum energy, does not get diluted). As
a result, we find regions in the (fa,Λ) plane where all constraints are satisfied, as shown in
fig. 3, 5, Furthermore, in the SU(N )→ SO(N ) model, Z2 monopoles arise at the cosmological
phase transition. We argued that SO(N ) confinement ruins their topological stability, but we
also considered the opposite possibility of stable monopoles, showing that they could provide
extra DM through the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.
All in all, such models predict strongly coupled dynamics at Λ� fa and are thereby more
testable than other proposed solutions to the PQ quality problem (based e.g. on discrete or
abelian gauge symmetries), where the new dynamics remains confined to very high energies.
While Λ might be larger than scales explorable at colliders, the new physics has implications
for cosmology, with possible non-trivial cosmological interplays among different sources of DM.

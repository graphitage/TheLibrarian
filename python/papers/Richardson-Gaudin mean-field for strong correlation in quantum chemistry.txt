Ground state eigenvectors of the reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Hamiltonian are
employed as a wavefunction ansatz to model strong electron correlation in quantum
chemistry. This wavefunction is a product of weakly-interacting pairs of electrons.
While other geminal wavefunctions may only be employed in a projected Schrödinger
equation, the present approach may be solved variationally with polynomial cost.
The resulting wavefunctions are used to compute expectation values of Coulomb
Hamiltionans and we present results for atoms and dissociation curves which are in
agreement with doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) data. The present
approach will serve as the starting point for a many-body theory of pairs, much as
Hartree-Fock is the starting point for weakly-correlated electrons.

I. INTRODUCTION
The majority of electronic structure methods are built upon the orbital picture. In the
simplest models, electrons are understood to behave essentially independently, interacting
only with the average field produced by the other electrons. This picture is acceptable when
it is possible to assign orbitals unambiguously as occupied or unoccupied, i.e., when the
energy gap between the occupied and unoccupied orbitals is large compared with the kinetic
energy of the valence electrons. The simplest wavefunction ansatz, i.e. a single Slater deter-
minant with a set of N (number of electrons) occupied orthonormal spin orbitals optimised
to produce the lowest energy in Hartree-Fock theory already produces a good first approxi-
mation. Further expansion in terms of Slater determinants is obtained by including singly-,
doubly-, ... excited Slater determinants with respect to the Hartree-Fock Slater determinant
leading to a better approximation of the electronic wavefunction that is most often domi-
nated by the Hartree-Fock determinant1. Systems of this type are weakly-correlated and are
generally well described by density functional theory (DFT), and coupled-cluster theory2
with singles, doubles, and (perturbative) triples.
However, when it is difficult to label orbitals as occupied or unoccupied, this picture
breaks down. The number of important Slater determinants grows exponentially with the
system size, so a single Slater determinant is not a qualitative representation of the electronic
wavefunction. Such systems are strongly-correlated. State of the art methods include the
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)3–16 and Slater determinant Monte-Carlo17–30.
The high computational cost of these methods has motivated the pursuit of approximate
methods for treating strongly-correlated systems generally with mean-field cost. This con-
tribution is a step in that direction: we employ the eigenvectors for a schematic system as
a variational ansatz. The key idea is to work in a framework in which strong-correlation is
described by the mean-field. In this new basis, the electronic wavefunction will have a short
expansion dominated by a single contribution, though it will not necessarily be a Slater
determinant.
Thus, we have been studying wavefunctions built as products of geminals, i.e. pairs of
electrons. Geminal wavefunctions have been proposed since the founding days of quantum
chemistry, as they tie in with the intuitive chemical picture of Lewis bonds as pairs of
electrons31. Unfortunately, the most general geminal wavefunctions come with a computa-
2
tional cost that scales exponentially with the system size, hence they were soon abandoned
for other methods. The intrinsic reason for the pernicious cost can be inferred from the
antisymmetrized product of interacting geminals (APIG), which is a general product of
closed-shell singlet geminals32.
The expansion coefficients in the basis of Slater determinants are permanents of the gem-
inal coefficients, and are combinatorially difficult to evaluate in general33. There are several
approaches to simplifying the problem to one that is tractable, each of which amounts to
making particular approximations. The first is to make all the geminals identical resulting
in the antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP)34, or equivalently a number-projection of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz35,36. AGP is well studied and is easy to employ,
but suffers the major drawback of not being size-consistent. The second is to partition the
orbitals in such a way that in each geminal, each orbital has one partner as in generalized va-
lence bond-perfect pairing (GVB-PP)37, a set of unique partners as in the antisymmetrized
product of strongly-orthogonal geminals (APSG)38, or one major occupied contribution as
in the antisymmetrized product of 1-reference orbital geminals (AP1roG39). In a series of
papers, we have proposed and investigated AP1roG as a computationally facile wavefunc-
tion to describe strong correlation due to bond-breaking39–44. It was found that AP1roG
systematically reproduces ground-state energies of doubly-occupied configuration interac-
tion (DOCI) calculations for molecular systems39, even for large system sizes45. The key
ingredient in the AP1roG formalism is that the Schrödinger equation is solved projectively
with respect to a set of selected reference states, very much in the spirit of coupled-cluster
theory (CC). In particular, it is equivalent to pair-coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD)46–49. As
a result, the permanents one needs to compute all become very easy to evaluate. Indeed,
the computational bottleneck in the AP1roG calculations is the orbital optimization (OO),
rather than the computation of the geminal coefficients in the AP1roG wavefunction. The
energies of geminal theories are strongly dependant on the orbital pairing scheme used43,50.
It was found that Hartree-Fock orbitals are typically well-suited for pairing correlations
around equilibrium geometries, whereas pairing occurs preferentially in localized orbitals in
the bond-dissociation regime50. Geminal theories perform well in the latter regime as strong
correlations tend to dominate weak ones. Efforts to incorporate weak correlation in these
geminal wavefunctions rely on multi-reference pertubation theory (MRPT)51,52, the random-
phase approximation (RPA)53, or generalize the algebraic structure of spin-singlet geminal
3
theory in order to include spin-triplet excitations as well54. The main hurdle on the way to
an all-inclusive geminal theory is the ability to include missing correlations systematically,
like CC theory or truncated configuration-interaction (CI) approaches1. This is one of the
main motivations for the approach herein presented. It has recently been observed that the
seniority scheme provides a new means to organize the Hilbert space for configuration inter-
action approaches in a hierarchical way. The seniority quantum number counts the number
of electrons that are not paired55. In this framework, the DOCI method corresponds to the
seniority-zero rung on the ladder. DOCI is size-extensive, in the correct basis, and captures
the majority of strong-correlation, at the cost of combinatorial scaling typical for full CI
methods albeit now in pair space.
With this in mind, we follow a third approach in this contribution, in which we propose a
structured geminal wavefunction such that the required permanents may be easily evaluated.
Specifically, we employ the ground-state eigenvectors of the reduced BCS Hamiltonian, or
Richardson Hamiltonian56 as a variational wavefunction ansatz. It is well-established that
the Richardson, or Richardson-Gaudin (RG), model is a quantum integrable system for
which the eigenvectors can be obtained using Bethe-Ansatz techniques57,58. From a quantum
chemistry point of view, it is highly remarkable that these eigenvectors have the structure
of a geminal wavefunction, completely characterized by means of the single-electron model
parameters, the pairing strength, and a set of so-called rapidities. There are as many
rapidities as there are electron pairs which means that the eigenvectors can be determined
by solving a set of equations for the rapidities with a computational scaling that is linear
with the system size, rather than the typical combinatorial scaling. Moreover, the norms,
scalar products, and 1- & 2-body reduced density matrices (1-RDM & 2-RDM) can all be
computed with a polynomial cost. This opens an avenue for a variational geminal theory in
quantum chemistry. We have already reported first results for LiH, Li2 and HF dissociation
curves in previous work44, so we will focus on the mathematical details in the present paper.
It should be emphasized that in our approach the object being optimized is the model
Hamiltonian (in this case RG), not simply an ansatz for the wavefunction. As a result,
we obtain a complete set of eigenvectors with which to construct perturbative corrections,
Green’s functions etc., all of which are physically well-founded and interpretable.
Similar ideas using the framework of exactly-solvable models as a many-body expansion
technique are being explored outside the field of quantum chemistry. In nuclear structure
4
physics, eigenvectors of RG models are being used as a starting point for a CI approach59. In
condensed matter physics, a variational RG approach is used to treat integrability-breaking
interactions in central-spin problems60, and a CI framework has been developed for non-
integrable spin chains in the truncated spectrum approximation61. Recently, we have de-
veloped the analogue of Hartree-Fock as a Bethe ansatz to serve as a bridge to the present
contribution62.
In section II we outline the basics of RG models, introduce the eigenvectors and develop
the variational principle to be employed. In section III we present numerical results for 4-,
6-, 8- and 10-electron atomic systems as well as dissociation curves for H2, H4, H6, H8 and
N2. We formulate our conclusions in section IV.
II. VARIATIONAL ANSATZ
A. Eigenvectors of the Reduced BCS Hamiltonian
We employ a pseudospin representation of su(2) for a set of spatial orbitals {i}, each of
which can contain a single pair of opposite spin electrons. For each spatial orbital there are
three operators:
S+i = a
†
i↑a
†
i↓, S
−
i = ai↓ai↑, S
z
i =
1
2
(
a
†
i↑ai↑ + a
†
i↓ai↓ − 1
)
, (1)
where a
†
i↑ (ai↓) creates (removes) an up- (down-)spin electron in spatial orbital i, etc. S
+
i
adds a pair of electrons to spatial orbital i and S−i removes a pair. Each spatial orbital can
only hold one pair. Acting on a doubly-occupied spatial orbital, Szi gives
1
2
, while acting on
an empty spatial orbital Szi gives −
1
2
. Thus Szi “measures” whether spatial orbital i is full or
empty. For singly occupied orbitals, its action is zero. For doubly-degenerate spin orbitals,
the seniority quantum number can be obtained as the expectation value of the operator55,63
Ωi = a
†
i↑ai↑ + a
†
i↓ai↓ − 2a
†
i↑ai↑a
†
i↓ai↓. (2)
We work only in the seniority zero sector 〈Ωi〉 = 0, ∀i in this paper, although it is perfectly
possible to extend the formalism to other sectors. This extension is one of the strengths of
the present approach.
Using the fermionic anticommutation relations, it is easily verified that the operators, (1),
commute for distinct spatial orbitals, so that the structure constants of their Lie algebra

where the parameters defining the system are the single particle spectrum {εi}, and the
pairing strength g. In this convention, a positive g represents an attractive pairing inter-
action. The eigenvectors are products of electron pairs distributed over the entire space of
orbitals, each pair being characterized by a complex number u (which we call a rapidity).
Such an electron pair is denoted
S+(u) =

The state |θ〉 is the vacuum, defined such that
S−i |θ〉 = 0, ∀ i = 1, K (8)
meaning that it is destroyed by all pair removal operators. In this contribution we take |θ〉 to
be the empty state, but it could easily be taken as a set of non-interacting unpaired electrons
(Slater determinant). The reduced BCS Hamiltonian was first solved by Richardson56,64 and
elaborated by Gaudin65. Thus as a shorthand, we will refer to the state (6) as a Richardson-
Gaudin (RG) state.
For a system with M pairs distributed among K spatial orbitals, there are
(
K
M
)
eigen-
vectors corresponding to the
(
K

)
solutions of Richardson’s equations. These equations
6
are highly non-linear, with singularities hampering a straightforward numerical character-
ization of the eigenvectors. In the last decade, many new numerical methods have been
developed to properly control and possibly avoid the singularities in the equations. These
methods range from clusterization methods66, Heine-Stieltjes connections67, probabilistic
approaches68, pseudo-deformations of the su(2) pairing algebra (1)69 and, most recently,
eigenvalue-based methods70,71.In this work we employed eigenvalue-based methods.
B. Energy Functional
We will now outline a variational method employing the eigenvectors of the reduced BCS
Hamiltonian (as a model system) to approximate solutions of a Coulomb Hamiltonian de-
scribing physical electrons. The reduced BCS Hamiltonian is defined by K + 1 parameters:
the single particle energies {ε} and the pairing strength g, which are the variational param-
eters. Our purpose is to employ the RG state |{u}〉 as a variational ansatz for a Coulomb
Hamiltonian,
ĤC =

with σ and τ spin variables. The one-electron hij and two-electron integrals Vijkl are calcu-
lated in a basis of orthonormal spatial orbitals {φ}:

(11)
with RI and ZI being the positions and charges of the nuclei.
Thus, with the RG state |{u}〉 as an ansatz, our approximation to the ground state energy
is
E[{ε}, g] = min
{ε},g
〈{u}|ĤC |{u}〉
〈{u}|{u}〉
(12)
The RG state is the ground state of the reduced BCS Hamiltonian, which is in turn defined
by the parameters {ε} and g. Thus the energy is to be minimized over these parameters.
We do not optimize over rapidities, as they are dictated as the solutions of Richardson’s
equations for a set of {ε}, g. It is of paramount importance that we may evaluate (12) with
7
a reasonable cost. This is possible thanks to the structure of (6). The 1-body reduced
density matrix (1-RDM) is diagonal and doubly-degenerate, as the α and β electrons are
treated identically. We adopt the convention
γi =
1
2
〈{u}|n̂i|{u}〉 = 〈{u}|Szi |{u}〉+
1
2
〈{u}|{u}〉 . (13)
Here, n̂i counts the number of electrons in the spatial orbital i, so the elements of the 1-
RDM count the number of pairs in each site. They are real numbers between zero and one.
The 2-body reduced density matrix (2-RDM) has two non-zero pieces: the pair correlation
function,
Pij = 〈{u}|a

The diagonal elements Pii and Dii correspond to the same elements of the 2-RDM, so to
avoid double counting we set the elements Dii = 0. The state (6) is not normalized, and
hence neither are the expressions for the correlation functions (13), (14), and (15)

(23)
where ~Gc denotes the cth column of the Gaudin matrix Eq. (18), ~B is the column vector:
~Bk =
(2uk − εi − εj)
(uk − εi)2(uk − εj)2
, (24)
and ~C is the column vector:
~Ck =
1
(uk − εi)2
. (25)
With explicit expressions for the correlation functions, we can evaluate the energy func-
tional (16) with a cost of O(N6): each element of the 2-RDM requires a single summation
over determinants, and there are N2 elements to compute. Through optimal book-keeping
and storage of computed determinants, it would be possible to improve the scaling, though
9
for our purposes we consider this a dead end. More optimal expressions for the correla-
tion functions exist that we will report in a following publication. Our initial guess for
the variational parameters {ε} was based on the diagonal elements of the 1-electron inte-
grals, perturbed with some random noise. For g, we started with a small negative value.
While the reduced BCS Hamiltonian has N + 1 parameters, 2 degrees of freedom are lost
to choose the scale and reference point for the energy. Thus we could optimize over N − 1
parameters, but we found that allowing all N + 1 parameters to vary led to more robust
convergence. The non-linear relationship between the reduced BCS Hamiltonian parameters
{ε}, g and the pair-energies {u} suggests that numerical gradients of the energy functional
are not an effective tool for minimization. Indeed, we have confirmed this with our prelimi-
nary numerical tests. We instead chose to use the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm77 which
worked effectively. There is always the danger that Nelder-Mead will find the wrong opti-
mum, though we have eliminated this issue by preconditioning with the covariance matrix
adaptation evolution strategy78.
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Calculations were performed for a series of four-, six-, eight-, and ten-electron atomic
systems as well as for dissociation of hydrogren chains and molecular nitrogen. Results are
compared with doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI)79 and full configuration
interaction (CI). Full CI calculations were performed with psi480,81 and verified with an in-
house code, DOCI calculations were performed with an in-house code, and RHF calculations
were performed with Gaussian 1682. We have noted previously that seniority-zero wavefunc-
tion ansätze favour localized, valence-bond-like orbitals, rather than the delocalized orbitals
obtained from RHF. Thus, dissociation curves were computed both in the basis of RHF or-
bitals and the basis of orbital optimized DOCI (OO-DOCI) orbitals. Orbital optimization in
the OO-DOCI calculations was performed as MC-SCF calculations in the complete doubly-
occupied Slater determinant basis with a Newton-Raphson scheme for the optimization for
the determinant and orbital coefficients as implemented in GAMESS(US)83. To explore the
orbital optimization space more profoundly, several starting bases were constructed includ-
ing the RHF orbitals, FCI natural orbitals and random orbitals obtained from rotating the
other bases.
10
The variational RG results should always be compared with DOCI: when computed in
the same set of orbitals, RG is a strictly variational approximation to DOCI. For atoms,
calculations were performed with STO-6G and with aug-cc-pVDZ, while dissociation curves
were computed with STO-6G. As our results are proof of principle, our algorithm is not
optimal, which unfortunately limits the size of system we can treat. However, results with
STO-6G will isolate effects of strong-correlation. Effects of weak correlation are minimal in
STO-6G as there are limited weak excitations possible. Thus, dissociation curves computed
with STO-6G are meaningful and relevant.
A. Atoms
Raw energetic results for atomic systems are reported in Table I (STO-6G) and Table
II (aug-cc-pVDZ). Each atomic system considered was necessarily treated as a closed-shell
singlet. All calculations are performed with the RHF orbitals. Again, for a given basis, in
this case RHF orbitals, the best possible result in the space of seniority-zero wavefunctions
is DOCI. Thus, we summarize the deviations from DOCI in table III.
For the four-electron series there is one pair of electrons deeply entrenched in the 1s core,
while the second pair resides principally in the 2s spatial orbital. The 2s-2p gap shrinks as
the central charge becomes more positive, and thus the electronic configurations with the
second pair occupying the 2p spatial orbitals become important, which makes these systems
strongly correlated. All the important Slater determinants in the physical wavefunction are
seniority zero, so DOCI is near-exact, as are our variational RG results.
In the six-electron series there are two pairs of electrons in the valence orbitals, and the
systems are once again strongly-correlated. However, DOCI is not as good a treatment,
as there is weak-correlation from open-shell singlet states missing from DOCI. The same is
generally true for the results of the eight-electron series.
For the ten-electron series the dominant effect is weak electron correlation. The 2s-2p
gap again gets smaller as the central charge increases, but the 2p-3s gap remains large, and
thus there is a single Slater determinant which dominates the physical wavefunction. As a
result, DOCI is not quantitatively accurate and neither is our variational calculation. We
do not report results for STO-6G as HF is full CI for this case.
In each case we were able to reproduce from half to two-thirds of the correlation energy

obtainable by DOCI, which is the best-case scenario for this wavefunction ansatz. To recover
the complete DOCI correlation energy, one way to proceed is to write an expansion in terms
of eigenvectors of the reduced BCS Hamiltonian. As we already recover the majority of the
correlation energy, we are optimistic that such an expansion is short, and dominated by one
RG state. We are now pursuing this line of reasoning and will report in the future.
B. Dissociation curves: RHF orbitals
The prototypical strongly-correlated systems are bond-dissociation curves. As it is a
two-electron problem, we expect to be able to dissociate the hydrogen molecule perfectly.
Indeed this is the case, as can be seen in Figure 1, where the RG, DOCI, and FCI curves
overlap. The error with respect to DOCI is very small.

in figure 2, the results are no longer exact. As all calculations are in the RHF basis, DOCI
and FCI differ appreciably. The error for RG with respect to DOCI is no longer zero, but
grows continuously to a maximum before dropping off substantially. At the critical point,
where the deviation is maximal, more than one RG state is required to match with DOCI.
The same trends are observed for H6 and H8.

Hydrogen dissociation chains were also computed in the basis of OO-DOCI orbitals, in
which the DOCI curve is much closer to the full CI result. Curves are plotted for H4, H6
and H8 in figure 3. The results for each of the hydrogen chains are the same. The error
with respect to DOCI in the RG curve grows continuously before decreasing to less than

size-consistent.

but approaches the DOCI curve much more quickly. There is a curve crossing near 5.2
Bohr which indicates that there is more than one RG state required near that point. At

IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed variational calculations for chemical systems employing the ground
state eigenvector of the exactly solvable reduced BCS Hamiltonian. The key idea is that
this treatment is a mean-field of pairs of electrons, rather than a mean-field of individual
electrons, as in conventional orbital-based approaches. Analogous to the way Hartree-Fock is
the dominant contribution to the wavefunction of a system with weakly-correlated electrons,
the present method is the dominant contribution to a wavefunction of a system with weakly-
correlated pairs of electrons.
Our results serve as a starting point to develop a many-body theory for pairs of electrons.
We are satisfied that they qualitatively reproduce DOCI. They also highlight issues to be
addressed in upcoming contributions. It is obvious that RHF orbitals are not optimal
for seniority-zero wavefunctions, as we have studied previously. Weak-correlation of pairs,
or inter-pair correlation, is missing, and perturbation theories will need to be developed.
Finally, while our method scales polynomially, it should be a smaller polynomial to be taken
seriously. All of these problems are solvable, and we are currently addressing them.

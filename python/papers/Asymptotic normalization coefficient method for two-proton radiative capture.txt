abstract
The method of asymptotic normalization coefficients is a standard approach for studies of two-body non-resonant radiative capture
processes in nuclear astrophysics. This method suggests a fully analytical description of the radiative capture cross section in the low-
energy region of the astrophysical interest. We demonstrate how this method can be generalized to the case of three-body 2p radiative
captures. It was found that an essential feature of this process is the highly correlated nature of the capture. This reflects the complexity
of three-body Coulomb continuum problem. Radiative capture

1. Introduction
In the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) approach
the nuclear wave function (WF) is characterized only by the
behavior of its asymptotics. This asymptotics is defined in
terms of the modified Bessel function of the second kind K in
neutral case
ψgs(r → ∞) = C2
√
2qr/πKl+1/2(qr) ∼ C2 exp[−qr] ,
or in terms of the Whittaker function W in Coulombic case
ψgs(r → ∞) = C2W−η,l+1/2(2qr) ∼ C2 (2kr)−η exp[−qr] ,
where η = Z1Z2e
2M/q is Sommerfeld parameter. Thus the
asymptotics and, hence, the related observables are defined
just by two parameters: the g.s. binding energy Eb = q
2/(2M)
and the 2-body ANC value C2.
Such an approximation is valid for highly peripheral pro-
cesses. The nonresonant radiative capture reactions at as-
trophysical energies are the main subject of interest here [
1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. An asymptotic normalization coefficient charac-
terizes the virtual decay of a nucleus into clusters and, thus,
it is equivalent to the coupling constant in particle physics [
6]. For that reason the ANC formalism naturally provides a
framework for deriving of the low-energy astrophysical infor-
mation from peripheral reactions, such as direct transfer reac-
tions, at intermediate energies (the so-called “Trojan horse”

method [ 7, 8, 9]). From the short list of references above,
it can be seen that the ANC study is quite active and has a
number of controversial unresolved issues.
For the network nucleosynthesis calculations in a thermal-
ized stellar environment it is necessary to determine the as-
trophysical radiative capture rates 〈σpart,γv〉. The two-body
resonant radiative captures

can be related to experimentally observable quantities [ 10,
11, 12]: resonance position Er, gamma Γγ and Γpart particle
widths (n = 1 for two-body and n = 2 for three-body cap-
tures).
The situation is much more complicated for nonresonant
radiative capture rates. The direct measurements of the low-
energy capture cross sections could be extremely difficult. For
the three-body capture rates the direct measurements of the
capture cross sections are not possible. Therefore, experimen-
tal approaches to three-body processes include studies of the
photo and Coulomb dissociation, which are reciprocal pro-
cesses for radiative captures. However, the “extrapolation” of
three-body cross sections from experimentally accessible en-
ergies to the low energies, important for astrophysics, may
require tedious theoretical calculations. This is because rela-
tively simple “standard” quasiclassical sequential formalism [
10, 11] may not work in essentially quantum mechanical cases
[ 12, 13, 14, 15].

The 2n and 2p nonresonant radiative capture rates have
been investigated in a series of papers Ref. [ 13, 14, 15] by the
examples of the 4He+n+n→ 6He+γ and 15O+p+p→ 17Ne+γ
transitions. This work also required the development of
exactly solvable approximations to understand underlying
physics of the process and achieve the accuracy needed for
astrophysical calculations [ 16, 17, 18]. Some of the universal
physical aspects observed in the papers mentioned above have
motivated the search for simple analytic models. The follow-
ing qualitative aspects of the low-energy E1 strength function
(SF) behavior were emphasized in [ 13, 14, 15]: (i) sensitivity
to the g.s. binding energy Eb; (ii) sensitivity to the asymptotic
weights of configurations determining the transition; (iii) im-
portance of one of near-threshold resonances in the two-body
subsystems (virtual state in n-n channel in the neutral case
and lowest resonance in the core-p channel in the Coulombic
case), which effect on SF is found to be crucial even at asymp-
totically low three-body energies. Points (i) and (ii) are the
obvious otivation for ANC-like developments; point (iii) repre-
sents important and problematic difference from the two-body
case.
This work to some extent summarize this line of research
suggesting analytical framework for two-nucleon astrophysical
capture processes. We demonstrate that it is possible to gen-
eralize the two-body ANC2 method to the ANC3 method in
the situation of three-body radiative captures. While for the
2n capture practical applicability of ANC3 method remains
questionable, for the 2p captures it is established beyond any
doubt. In this work we provide compact fully analytical frame-
work for the processes, which previously could be considered
only in bulky and unstable three-body calculations.
2. ANC3 in the hyperspherical harmonics (HH) ap-
proximation
The HH formalism for calculations of the E1 SF is provided
in details in Ref. [ 19] and here we just give a sketch. Assume
that the bound and continuum wave functions (WF) can be
described in a three-cluster core+N+N approach by solving
the three-body Schrödinger equation
(Ĥ3 − ET )Ψ = 0 ,
Ĥ3 = T̂3 + V12(r12) + V23(r23) + V31(r31) + V3(ρ) , (2)
where ET is energy relative to the three-cluster breakup
threshold. See Fig. 1 for definition of coordinates used in this
work. In the hyperspherical harmonics method this equation
is reduced to a set of coupled differential equations

“scaling” mass M is taken as an average nucleon mass in the
system. The three-body potentials are defined as
VK′γ′,Kγ(ρ) = 〈JK′γ′ |
∑
i>j Vij(rij)|JKγ〉 .
The effective orbital momentum L = K + 3/2 is nonzero even
for the lowest excitation K = 0.

χJKγ,K′γ′(κρ) = exp(iδKγ,K′γ′)[JL′ (κρ) cos(δKγ,K′γ′)
in analogy with the two-body case. The details of the method
and its applications are well explained in the literature [ 20,
21, 12, 22] and we will not dwell on that too much.
The form of hyperspherical equations (3) immediately pro-
vides the vision for the low-energy behavior of observables in
E1 continuum since the only K = 1 component with the lowest
centrifugal barrier is important in the ET → 0 limit.
The E1 transitions between three-body cluster core+N+N
states are induced by the following operator

∑
i=1,3
Zi ri Y1m(r̂i) =
√
3/(4π)Dm ,
where D =

one is for core+p+p three-body systems, taking into account
the c.m. relation r1 + r2 = −A3r3 for the three-body system.

κρ JKf+2(κρ) ∼ (κρ)Kf+5/2/[(Kf + 2)! 2Kf+2] . (7)
This expression can be used to separate the leading term of
the low-energy dependence of the matrix element, labeled for
simplicity only by the values ofK for the initial and final states
MKfKi(ET ) =
√

where the overlap integral IKfKi tends to a constant at ET →
0 and weakly depends on energy in the range of interest.
Let us consider only the transition from the lowest bound
state component Ki = 0 to the lowest E1 continuum compo-
nent with Kf = 1:

Now we replace the bound state WF χ in Eq. (9) by its long-
range asymptotic expressed in terms of the three-body ANC
value C3 and cylindrical Bessel functions K
χK=0(ρ) → C3
√
2κρ/πK2(κρ) , (11)
where the g.s. hypermoment κ =
√
2MEb is defined via the
binding energy Eb. This approximation is valid in a broad
range of ρ values, see Fig. 2. The 6He WF is taken from [
19, 15]. The overlap integral now has simple analytical form
I10(ET ) = 4 C3 /[(2MEb)11/4(1 + ET /Eb)2] . (12)
It can be found that the ANC3 approximation of the overlap
value (12) deviates within very reasonable ∼ 7% limits from
the directly calculated by Eq. (9) in a broad energy range
(ET . 1 MeV).
2.2. Discussion of 6He case
The E1 SF and astrophysical capture rate for the α+n+n →
6He+γ was recently studied in Refs. [ 15, 19]. It can be found
that Eq. (10) is not sufficient in this case for two reasons:
(i) In the p-shell 6He nucleus not only the Ki = 0 → Kf = 1
transition is important, but also Ki = 2 → Kf = 1. The
asymptotics of the Ki = 2 WF component falls off much faster
than that of the component Ki = 0. However, the weight of
the Ki = 2 WF component corresponding to [p
2] configura-
tion is much larger (∼ 80%), than the weight of the Ki = 0
WF component (∼ 5%), due to Pauli-suppressed [s2] config-
uration. So, finally their contributions to the low-energy ME
are comparable.
(ii) It was shown in [ 15, 19] that the low-energy part of the
E1 SF is highly sensitive to the final state n-n interaction (an
increase in SF when the n-n interaction is taken into account
is a factor of 8). The paper [ 15] is devoted to the study of this
effect in the dynamic dineutron model. We do not currently
see a method to consider this effect analytically.
Applicability of the approximation (10) to the other cases
of 2n capture should be considered separately.
2.3. Coulomb case in HH approach
Let us consider the transition to the single Kf = 1 contin-
uum final state. The low-energy behavior of continuum single
channel WF in the Coulomb case is provided by the regular
at the origin Coulomb WF
χKf (κρ) →
√
2/π FKf+3/2(ηhh,κρ) . (13)
The suitable asymptotics of the Coulomb WFs are

Dl(η, k) =
(2l + 1)!C′l(η)
(2η)l+1
√
2β =
√
πk exp[−πη] , (18)
where I and K are modified Bessel functions. Approximation
(17) for the Coulomb coefficient (16) works for η ≫ l.
In the ANC3 approximation the g.s. WF χ can be replaced
by its long-range asymptotics
χKi(ρ) → C3W−ηgs,Ki+2(2κρ) . (19)
The Sommerfeld η for continuum and bound states are
βhh = Zhhe
2M , ηhh = βhh/κ , ηgs = Zhh e
2M/κ . (20)
The effective charges for isolated hyperspherical channels can
be defined as

very broad range of radii (the 17Ne g.s. WF is from Ref. [ 23]).

The effective charge in Eq. (22) obtained for Ki = 0 is very
reasonable. However, slightly different effective charge value
Z
(000)
hh = 26.14 is required for an almost perfect match to the
asymptotics. This is a clear indication of coupled-channel dy-
namics in this case. It is actually a nontrivial fact that all the
complexity of this dynamics reduces to a simple renormaliza-
tion of effective charges.
Using Eqs. (14) and (18) we can factorize the E1 matrix
element as:

The overlaps (23) for Ki = 0 → Kf = 1 transition are shown
in Fig. 3. It can be found that in the ANC3 approximation the
Eq. (19) is quite accurate: in this case the overlap increases
just less than 6% compared the calculation with the real g.s.
WF. It is also seen that the use of simple energy-independent
overlap Eq. (24) instead of (23) gives almost perfect result
below 10 keV and is reasonable below 100 keV. For the E1 SF
we get:

The energy dependence of the derived expression at ET → 0
is pure Coulomb exponent exp[−2πηhh]. The SF calculation
results are shown in Fig. 4. They strongly disagree with cal-
culation results from Refs. [ 13] and [ 14]. The modification
of the “effective continuum charge” Z
(101)
hh from Eq. (22) does
not save the situation since the energy dependence of the SF
in Eq. (25) and that of the SF in [ 13, 14] are too different.
We demonstrate in the next section that the Eq. (25) is actu-
ally incorrect. However, the derivations of this section are still
important for our further discussion.

3. ANC3 in the simplified Hamiltonian (SH) approx-
imation
The approximation is based on the usage of a simplified
three-body Hamiltonian for the E1 continuum instead of the
real one
Ĥ3 → Ĥ ′3 = T̂3 + Vcn(X) + Vy(Y) , (26)
where X ≡ r31 is the Jacobi vector in the “Y” Jacobi system,
while Y corresponds to the second Jacobi vector, see Fig. 1.
Such a Hamiltonian is quite reliable since the nuclear inter-
action with a proton sitting in a non-natural parity state is
weak. The model was used for nonresonant astrophysical rate
calculations in 17Ne in Ref. [ 13] and in 6He in Ref. [ 15].
A thorough check of the model is given in Ref. [ 16], and a
detailed description of the formalism for complicated angular
momentum couplings in Ref. [ 14].
To obtain the E1 strength function in this approximation
we solve the following inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation:
(Ĥ ′3 − ET )Ψ
JfMf (+)
Mim
= OE1,mΨJiMigs .
The transition operator Eq. (4) depending on r3 can be rewrit-
ten in X and Y coordinates:
r3 = XA2/(A2 +A3) −YA1/(A1 +A2 + A3) . (27)
Since the factorized form of the Hamiltonian Eq. (26) allows a
semi-analytical expression for the three-body Green’s function,

where the “source function” Φ is defined by the E1 operator
acting on Ψgs. The WFs flx and fly are eigenfunctions of sub-
Hamiltonians depending on X and Y Jacobi coordinates in
S-matrix representation with asymptotics
fl(kr) = e
iδl [Fl(η, kr) cos(δl) +Gl(η, kr) sin(δl)] . (30)
Eq. (29) is provided in a simplified form, neglecting angular
momentum couplings, more details can be found in [ 14]. We
skip this part of the formalism in this work. The calculations
of the E1 strength function in the SH approximation without
final state interactions in X and Y channels for the 2n capture
are equivalent to calculations in the HH approximation. So,
we skip no Coulomb case and proceed to the 2p capture.
3.1. Coulomb case in SH approach
With good accuracy, one can calculate the amplitude only
for the Y coordinate and then double the result. This is not
difficult to prove, but tedious, so we do not provide a proof
here. The amplitude A for the Y coordinate [see Eq. (27)]
from the transition operator Eq. (4) with extracted by Eqs.
(14) and (18) low-energy dependence is written in terms of
the overlap integral I(cc) as

The WF ψgs and the integrand of Eq. (31) on the {X,Y }

illustrates the extreme peripheral character of the low-energy
E1 transition: the WF maximum is at a distance of ∼ 3 fm,
while sizable contributions to the transition ME can be found
up to ∼ 60 fm.

The Coulomb exponent in Iε has a very sharp energy depen-
dence, see Fig. 6. The energy dependence of I(cc) is shown
in Fig. 5 (c): it is quite flat for ε ≈ ε0. Thus, I(cc) can be
evaluated at the peak ε = ε0 and the ε integration can be
performed by the saddle point method:

The accuracy of the saddle point integration is ∼ 2% and ∼ 6%
at 0.1 and 1 MeV, respectively.
It can be found in Fig. 3 that the analytical energy depen-
dence of Eq. (12) obtained for the system without Coulomb
interaction is still a good approximation in the considered

Eq. (38) contains additional Coulomb correction for ly = 1
motion in Y coordinate (with Ecy = 3.67 MeV) and we use it
later for astrophysical rate derivation.
The results of the SF calculation in the SH approximation
are shown in Fig. 4 by the red dashed curve. Now there is no
significant disagreement for ET → 0 of the SH model results
with calculation results from Refs. [ 13] and [ 14]. In the next
Sections 3.2 and 3.3 we answer the following questions: (i)
what is the reason for the difference between HH and SH ANC3
methods and (ii) can we get a better “fit” of the complicated
three-body results in the SH approximation?

3.2. Correlated 2p emission/capture

SF expressions with the low-energy asymptotics

∝ exp(−2πηhh) ,
dBE1

∝ E5/4T exp(−2πηsh) , (39)
which are qualitatively different. There are two main points.
(i) Effective charge, entering the Coulomb exponent is signif-
icantly lower in SH case, see Eq. (37) compared to Eq. (22):
27.41 vs. 23.282. (ii) There is an additional power dependence
on energy E
5/4
T which, evidently, cannot be compensated, for
example, by some modification of the effective charge. What
is the source of qualitative difference between Eqs. (25) and
(33)?
The answer is actually provided in Fig. 6: in the SH ap-
proach the emission of two protons is highly correlated pro-
cess, which produces the narrow ε bell-shaped distributions.
In the approximation Kf = 1 used in Eq. (25) the momentum
distribution is described by the phase space (thick gray curve
in Fig. 6). In the correlated calculation Eq. (33) this distribu-
tion is drastically modified by the three-body Coulomb effect.
The momentum distribution which “shrinks” to the proximity
of the ε0 value allows easier penetration, which is reflected also
in the smaller effective charge (37) in the Coulomb exponent
in Eq. (39).
So, what is wrong with Eq. (25)? Formally the transition
by the dipole operator from Ki = 0 g.s. occurs only to Kf = 1
continuum, as we assumed. This means that the substitution
of Eq. (13) is incorrect. This substitution is based on the as-
sumption that for ET → 0 only the component with minimal
possible Kf = 1 and, hence, the smallest centrifugal barrier,
contributes to the penetrability. Now it is clear that for the
three-body continuum Coulomb problem this “evident” argu-
ment is absolutely incorrect. Within the complete HH couple-
channel problem the Kf = 1 channel should be affected by
an infinite sum of the other channels in such a way that their
cumulative effect does not vanish even in the limit ET → 0.
Analogous energy correlation effect is well known for the 2p
radioactivity process. It was predicted by Goldansky in his
pioneering work on 2p radioactivity [ 24]: in the Coulomb-
correlated emission of two protons the energies of the protons
tend to be equal in the limit of infinitely strong Coulomb in-
teraction in the core+p channel. This effect for two-proton
radioactivity and resonant “true” two-proton emission is now
well studied experimentally and understood in details in the-
oretical calculations [ 22, 25]. It is proved that the approxi-
mations like Eq. (33) represent well the underlying physics of
the phenomenon.
3.3. Effect of a resonant state in a two-body subsys-
tem
It was shown in calculations of [ 13, 14] (see Figs. 3 and
4-5 in these works) that the resonant state in the core-p sub-
system with “natural parity” quantum numbers significantly
affects both the profile of the E1 strength function in a wide
range of energies and the asymptotic behavior at low ET val-
ues. To evaluate the influence of resonance on the asymptotics
analytically, let us consider the two-body resonant scattering
WF in the quasistationary approximation:
fl(kr) = e
iδlFl(kr) cos(δl)+
√
v Γ(E)/2
Er − E − iΓ(E)/2
ψ̃l(r) . (40)
This expression can be easily connected with the asymptotics
Eq. (30) by using the resonant R-matrix formulas:
tan(δl) =
Γ(E)
Er − E
→ eiδl sin(δl) =
Γ(E)/2
Er − E + iΓ(E)/2
. (41)
The ψ̃l(r) is so-called quasistationary WF, defined at resonant
energy Er by the irregular Coulomb WF boundary condition
and normalized to unity in the “internal region” r < rc:
ψ̃l(rc)
E=Er∝ Gl(krrc) ,
∫ rc
0
dr|ψ̃l(r)|2 = 1 . (42)
The low-energy behavior of the overlap integrals Eq. (31)
with the resonant continuum WF (40) in X coordinate is then

which is simplified in the low-energy region using Eq. (15).
The integrand of Eq. (44) is shown in Fig. 5 (d) and it
has quite peripheral character compared to the g.s. WF Fig.
5 (a). The “resonance correction function” B is shown in
Fig. 3 demonstrating very weak dependence on energy. It
is evaluated with function ψ̃lx(X) approximated by Hulten
Ansatz with rms X value 3.5 fm. Parameters θx = 1 and
rc = 3.7 fm allows to reproduce correctly the experimental
width Γ = 25(5) keV of the 16F 0− ground state at Er = 535
keV. So, in the whole energy range of interest we can approx-
imate B as
B̃ = B(ε0, ET → 0) . (46)
The blue dotted curve in Fig. 4 shows nice agreement of the
“resonance corrected” E1 SF with complete three-body calcu-
lations up to ∼ 600 keV. At this energy the two-body reson-
nace well enters the “energy window” for three-body capture
Er < ET and turnover to sequential capture mechanism is
taking place.

3.4. Astrophysical rate calculations
The nonresonant radiative capture rate is expressed via the
E1 SF as [ 14]:

where Ji and Jf are spins of the
15O and 17Ne g.s., respectively.
The energy dependence of Eq. (33) is too complex to allow a
direct analytical calculation of the astrophysical capture rate.
However, using Eqs. (35), (38), and (46), the main analytical
terms can be obtained by the saddle point calculation near the
Gamow peak energy EG:
IE(T ) ∝

The Gamow peak energy can be found as {0.05, 0.21, 1} MeV
at {0.01, 0.1, 1} GK. Comparison of the rates calculated in a
model of the paper Ref. [ 14] and in this work is provided
in Fig. 7. It can be seen that even the very crude energy-
independent approximation Eq. (32) I(cc)(ε, ET ) → Ĩ(cc) for
T < 0.5 GK works well within factor of 2. The energy-
dependent calculations Eq. (43) are nearly perfect for T < 0.2
GK and the analytical expression Eq. (48) for the rate is a very
good approximation to numerically computed rate for T < 0.4
GK.
The low-temperature dependence of the nonresonant 2p
capture rate is
〈σ2p,γ v〉 ∝ C23 T 5/3 exp[−(Teff/T )1/3] , kTeff ≈ 193 [MeV] .
Analogous dependence for the resonant rate is (e.g. Ref. [ 12])
〈σ2p,γ v〉 ∝ Γ2p T−3 exp[−(E3r/kT )1/3] , E3r = 355 [keV] ,
where E3r is the lowest state decaying via 2p emission with
Γ2p (for
17Ne this is the first excited 3/2− state). It is clear
that nonresonant capture dominates in the low-temperature
limit, see also discussion in Ref. [ 13].
So, we have obtained a compact analytical expression for the
2p capture rate, which depends only on the global parameters
of the system under consideration (C3, Eb, Er, Zsh) and two
universal overlaps (Ĩ(cc) and B̃) calculated at ET → 0.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, we provide a formalism for a complete an-
alytical description of low-energy three-body 2p nonresonant
radiative capture processes. The developed approach is a gen-
eralization of the ANC method, which has proven itself well
for two-body nonresonant radiative captures. The ordinary
(two-body) ANC2 method demonstrates the sensitivity of the
low-energy E1 strength function, important for astrophysics,
to only two parameters: the binding energy Eb and the ANC2
value C2. For the three-body ANC method one more param-
eter should be employed: the energy Er of the lowest to the
threshold “natural parity” two-body resonance with appropri-
ate quantum numbers.

orange curve shows the result of numerical rate calculation by Eq. (47)
and analytical result by Eq. (48) for the resoance-corrected I(cc)′(ε, ET )
from Eq. (43). Green dash-dotted curve shows the rate for simple energy-
independent SF I(cc)(ε, ET ) → Ĩ
(cc) from Eq. (32)
.
An interesting formal result is related to the problem of the
three-body Coulomb interaction in the continuum. We demon-
strate that ANC3 method developed completely in three-body
hyperspherical harmonics representation (named “HH approx-
imation”) is not valid in the Coulomb case as it gives incor-
rect low-energy asymptotics of SF and hence incorrect low-
temperature asymptotics of the astrophysical rate. The rea-
son for this is the highly correlated nature of the 2p capture.
The correct asymptotics can be obtained using the Coulomb-
correlated SH approximation based on a simplified three-body
Hamiltonian. The latter approximation also allows to deter-
mine the correction related to the low-lying two-body resonant
state in the core-nucleon channel.
The two-dimensional overlap integrals involved in the ANC3
approximation in the correlated Coulomb case are rather com-
plicated compared to those in the ANC2 case. However, their
calculation is a task that is incomparably simpler than any
complete three-body calculation. The whole formal framework
is compact and elegant and requires only two overlap calcula-
tions: Ĩ(cc) and B̃. Thus we find that ANC3 approximation in
a three-body case is a valuable development providing robust
tool for estimates of the three-body nonresonant capture rates
in the low-temperature (T . 0.3 − 1 GK).

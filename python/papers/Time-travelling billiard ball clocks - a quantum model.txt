We present a novel quantum circuit formulation of the time-travelling billiard ball paradox. We
show how the indeterministic histories of the paradox may be emulated via the incorporation of a
vacuum state into the circuit’s Hilbert space. By employing a quantum clock state, we demonstrate
how the multiple self-consistent trajectories of the billiard ball through the chronology-violating
region can be distinguished. This technique enables us to rigorously probe the mechanisms of
the two foremost quantum theories of time travel: Deutsch’s model (D-CTCs) and post-selected
teleportation (P-CTCs). The results of this method when applied to our billiard ball paradox
circuit prove to be nontrivial. These include observations such as how the suppression of the vacuum
subspace forces a particle (clock) to be on the CTC (thereby constraining all trajectories through
the circuit to interact with the CTC under both prescriptions), while the inclusion of a vacuum
causes the P-CTCs and D-CTCs output states to become a superposition and mixture respectively
of the CTC-interacting and CTC-noninteracting histories. We also demonstrate that under certain
conditions the P-CTCs results agree with a conjecture made by Friedman et al. [Phys. Rev. D 42,
1915 (1990)].
I. INTRODUCTION
Closed timelike curves (CTCs) form an interesting
class of objects within the general theory of relativity
as they present the possibility for an observer to travel
back in time. Consequently, any physical system may
be able to interact with its past-self, and so the poten-
tial existence of CTCs within our own universe naturally
evokes scientific investigation into time travel. The fore-
most focus of such research is on questions regarding the
nontrivial causal structure of CTC spacetimes and the
consistency of the standard laws of physics.
In some locally unobjectionable exact solutions to the
Einstein field equations, CTCs naturally occur. How-
ever, such spacetimes are often considered globally un-
physical (like the classic swirling dust solutions of van
Stockum [1] and Gödel [2]), and so the presence of inte-
rior CTCs is usually considered to be an artefact of the
theory. Despite this, it is believed that CTCs may be
theoretically constructed in more globally physical space-
times through the use of a traversable wormhole [3–5]. In
essence, a wormhole is an exotic, theoretical topological
object that connects two distant regions in space. In pop-
ular culture, wormholes (either artificially constructed or
naturally occurring) commonly provide a means of in-
terstellar (or even intergalactic) transportation. They
accomplish this by allowing spaceships to quickly tra-
verse their short, tubiform interiors and emerge at distant
locations far sooner than any alternative non-wormhole
routes would allow. Alternatively, if two separate mo-
ments in time were to be linked by wormhole instead
of two separate locations, one would possess a time ma-
chine [4, 6–9], i.e. a mechanism which can produce CTCs.
Thus, wormholes are theoretically able to facilitate both

long-distance space-travel and time travel. It is this basis
on which this study, and many others, is established.
The emergence of inconsistencies due to retrocausal
action in the evolution of a physical system is an issue
which is captured by the infamous grandfather paradox
(detailed in [5]). This problem, which is perhaps the fore-
most example of a time travel paradox, takes on many
forms, all of which share the common characteristic of an-
tichronological causation. The archetype of the paradox
often features an observer who travels back in time and,
through their actions (usually by interfering with the re-
lationship between their young grandparents), prevents
their own birth. Consequently, the observer is unable to
travel back in time to preclude their existence, and the
paradox is thus evident.
Time travel paradoxes and the concept of retrocausal-
ity lie at the foundation of the issues with CTCs. In
particular, the inconsistencies associated with paradoxi-
cal causal sequences have led to uncertainty regarding the
pathology of CTCs and hence their research suitability.
However, there is a distinct lack of evidence suggesting
that the inconsistencies of CTC paradoxes are entirely
inescapable. One may simply regard these problems as
ill-posed, given that the initial conditions (existence and
intervention intent of the observer) are influenced by the
future occurrences (observer stopping their grandparents
from meeting). To resolve this problem, we could sup-
pose that there exists some fundamental characteristic of
reality which forbids any future event from paradoxically
altering the past.
In particular, we could conjecture the existence an in-
nate law by which the universe operates, called the prin-
ciple of self-consistency [10], which prohibits paradoxical
causal sequences from transpiring. Under this condition,
a globally consistent solution of the local physical laws
must exist. This means that, while a system is allowed to
propagate into its own past, it must do so in a way that
is consistent with its own original history. Any interac-

tion that occurs must be compatible with the past, and
causal sequences containing events solely of this nature
are characterised as being self-consistent.
One way to explore the compatibility between the laws
of physics and CTCs is to determine whether the two
can be consolidated without having unacceptable causal-
ity violations manifest. This is typically accomplished
by studying the evolution of simple systems in space-
times containing CTCs, and one framework by which
this is achieved involves the Cauchy problem for clas-
sical fields in time machine spacetimes. In this prob-
lem, one seeks to, amongst other things, prove or dis-
prove the existence of the field solutions to the rele-
vant time evolution equations of motion given generic
initial data. By determining the nature of these solu-
tions, one is able to formulate conclusive remarks re-
garding the affinity of the union of (classical) field theory
and CTCs. Interestingly, research into the Cauchy prob-
lem in spacetimes with CTCs has yielded some perhaps
unanticipated results given the seemingly restrictive re-
quirement of self-consistency. Foremost are the findings
[10–19], which show that globally consistent time evolu-
tions for free relativistic classical scalar fields with generic
initial data (posed before any regions with CTCs) exist
and are generally unique in certain classes of nonglobally
hyperbolic (including CTC) spacetimes. Consequently,
at least in the context of noninteracting, classical scalar
fields, CTCs appear to be robust and spacetimes con-
taining them are not as pathological as one might have
initially suspected.
A. Time-travelling billiard balls
For a spacetime with one or more chronology-violating
sets (i.e. time machines), the past can be influenced by
the future, provided that any changes which are made
obey the self-consistency principle. The lack of such
changes (i.e. self-interactions) in the Cauchy problem for
noninteracting classical fields seems like a probable cause
of its well-posedness on CTC spacetimes. Alternatively,
a system that is able to self-interact (e.g. collide with
its past/future self) is more likely to display unusual
results—indeed, with an interacting field, uniqueness is
thought to be lost as the strength of the interaction in-
creases [14]. Therefore, in order to study this, models
of interacting systems near CTCs were developed, and
perhaps the most famous of these considers the elastic
self-collision(s) of a time-travelling billiard ball. In this
framework, a solid, elastic, spherical mass (the ‘billiard
ball’) enters one mouth of a wormhole, exits the other
at an earlier time (due to a time-shift having been in-
duced between the wormhole’s two mouths), and then
collides with its earlier (past) self. Depending on the ini-
tial position and velocity of the ball, drastically distinct
evolutions of the ball through the CTC-wormhole region
can arise.
Akin to that of grandfather paradox, some initial
conditions produce paradoxical trajectories. Known as
Polchinski’s paradox, any such contradictory evolution is
characterised by causally inconsistent self-interaction(s).
Typically, these scenarios involve the ball entering the
time machine’s future mouth, subsequently exiting the
past mouth, and then knocking its past self away, disal-
lowing itself from ever reaching the wormhole in the first
place.
On the other hand, studies [8, 10, 20–24] involving
time-travelling billiard balls have shown that, given the
same initial data posed in the presence of CTCs, there
can be multiple self-consistent solutions which satisfy the
equations of motion. Fig. 1 illustrates a prominent ex-
ample in which there are (at least) two distinct histories
through which the billiard ball may evolve in a CTC-
wormhole spacetime. This scenario is the foremost ex-
ample of the billiard ball paradox, and will hereafter be
referred to as such. Unlike in the case of the grandfa-
ther paradox, the paradoxical issue here is not of self-
inconsistent trajectories but is of the indeterminism in
the self-consistent ones. This is to say that solutions al-
ways exist because they self-adjust themselves (thereby
providing consistency), but we now have a different issue,
that of solution multiplicity. This new problem is an in-
teresting one, as the existence of more than one solution
to the equations of motion contrasts with the determin-
ism typically associated with classical mechanics.
It is natural to question whether the characteristic of

solution multiplicity is indeed merely an artefact of a clas-
sical description and vanishes in a fully self-consistent
quantum mechanical treatment, or whether it remains
as a pathological aspect of CTCs and time travel under
any physical description. In past work [10], it has been
suggested that the indeterminism problem of the billiard
ball paradox disappears in quantum theory. The rea-
soning behind this is that, unlike classical mechanics, a
quantum treatment provides one with ways of assigning
solution probabilities, thereby replacing the classical the-
ory’s multiplicity of solutions with a set of probabilities
for the outcomes of all sets of measurements.
For example, a quantum prescription based on the path
integral/sum-over-histories formulation tells us that clas-
sical trajectories coexist in a probabilistic sense. In a
prominent paper by Friedman et al. [10], the authors dis-
cuss such a prescription applied to the exact evolutions
depicted in Fig. 1. When the ball begins in a nearly
classical wave-packet, Friedman et al. postulate that a
WKB approximation to their sum-over-histories method
would find that the wave-packet emerges from the CTC-
wormhole region having travelled along either evolution
A or B with equal (i.e. 50%) probability. One interpre-
tation of this is to say that the associated quantum bil-
liard ball travels along both paths simultaneously through
the time machine region, thus ameliorating the indeter-
minism of classical mechanics. However, no calculation
is provided in Ref. [10] or subsequent papers to sup-
port their WKB approximation conjecture. Nonetheless,
the pioneering semiclassical method proposed by Fried-
man et al. motivates further study of this problem, as the
interesting probabilistic result they postulated is simply
inaccessible to classical mechanics.
B. Quantum billiard ball paradox
By its very nature, classical physics simply cannot
make sense of solution multiplicity. Despite this, quan-
tum treatments of specific instances of classical multi-
plicity in time travel paradoxes have not actually been
investigated in the literature. Prompted by this notable
absence of such studies, in this paper we present a novel
quantum model of the billiard ball paradox in which:
(i) We consider a simplified (1+1)-dimensional version
of the classical problem in which there are only two
possible paths;
(ii) We map this problem to a quantum circuit repre-
sentation and allow the particles to be present or
absent from particular paths; and
(iii) We include internal degrees of freedom on the par-
ticle that can operate as a clock and hence monitor
the proper time along different paths.
Our model is based upon two distinct mechanisms.
The first of these allows the billiard ball to effectively
function like a clock as a result of the incorporation of
an internal degree of freedom into its quantum descrip-
tion. Using this modification, we can measure the proper
time of the distinct classical evolutions A and B, thus al-
lowing us to determine which path the billiard ball took
through the time machine region. The second mechanism
is formed around the vacuum state. By considering such
a state to represent the absence of a billiard ball, we can
use it to allow the associated clock to either travel un-
perturbed (if there is nothing, i.e. ‘vacuum’, in the CTC)
or else be scattered into the CTC (if the billiard ball’s
future self is trapped inside in the CTC).
One of the open questions that we investigate here us-
ing our model is whether a quantum description does
indeed address the issue of evolution indeterminism. A
problem with this question however is that there is no
unique, well-defined way to treat the dynamics of physi-
cal systems near CTCs quantum mechanically. In this
work, our analysis of the model consists of two radi-
cally different approaches, where one (Deutsch’s model,
or D-CTCs) is based on the application of the self-
consistency principle to the time-travelling system’s den-
sity matrix, while the other (postselected teleportation,
or P-CTCs) involves the path integral/sum-over-histories
formulation.
In our findings, we observe a multiplicity of solutions in
the D-CTCs description, and we discuss how this arises
naturally as a choice of entropy-dependent ‘initial state’
in the CTC. We discuss how the classical form of these
solutions supports the multiple universes interpretation
typically associated with Deutsch’s model. Alternatively,
in P-CTCs, only one quantum state is offered by the pre-
scription as a solution to the paradox. Rather simply,
the state takes the form of a pure superposition of the
clock having evolved and not evolved on the CTC dur-
ing its history through the time machine region (with
the possible addition of a vacuum component depend-
ing on the specification of the input state). A focus of
these P-CTCs findings is how this superposition provides
strong support for the semiclassical billiard ball conjec-
ture of Friedman et al. in Ref. [10]. We also show how
P-CTCs places constraints on initial data (where such
restrictions depend on the future of the time-travelling
state), thereby limiting the actions that one is able to
perform in a P-CTCs universe.
We begin with an introduction to the quantum me-
chanical prescriptions of time travel (D-CTCs and P-
CTCs) in Sec. II and follow this with a description of our
quantum billiard ball paradox model in Sec. III (which
includes a specification of our clock state in Sec. III A).
General analytical results of the model along with visu-
alisations of various quantities (using qubit clocks) are
given in Sec. IV while discussions ensue in Sec. V. Con-
cluding remarks are lastly made in Sec. VI.

II. QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODELS OF
TIME TRAVEL
Naturally, the advent of CTCs in the semiclassical gen-
eral theory of relativity prompted study into quantum
theories of time travel. In the absence of a complete
quantum theory of gravity, reconciling CTCs with stan-
dard quantum mechanics forms a compelling basis for
research. Indeed, exploration into the interplay between
quantum mechanics and CTCs, even in only a theoreti-
cal manner, may provide insight into a yet unknown full
theory of quantum gravity. In any case, research into
this area has so far taken two main routes. The first, in
which the principle of self-consistency is applied to the
density matrix itself, gives the Deutsch model (D-CTCs).
The second, which is equivalent to a path integral for-
mulation, gives postselected teleportation (P-CTCs). Of
course, alternative prescriptions of quantum time travel
do exist [25–30], but none are as well-developed as either
D-CTCs or P-CTCs and so they will not be discussed in
this paper.
A. The Deutsch model
In 1991, David Deutsch [31] introduced a method
of analysing the flow of information in a chronology-
violating network. This prescription, now known as the
Deutsch model or D-CTCs, consists of a quantum theory
of computation applied to a CTC model where most of
the geometry has been abstracted away. It is based on
the requirement that time evolution of the local density
operator (taken as a fundamental object) of a quantum
system must be self-consistent.
1. Deutsch’s resolution to time travel paradoxes
One of the main results of Deutsch’s work on time
travel is his proposal for the time evolution of quan-
tum states through a quantum circuit representation of a
chronology-violating network, with particular note as to
how it resolves general time travel paradoxes (illustrated
in Fig. 2) and indeterminism.
The mathematical formulation of his self-consistent so-
lution is provided by requiring that any given chronology-
violating (CV) system enters the wormhole in the state
θ ∈ HCV, and then emerges in the past in the same state
despite having interacted with a chronology-respecting
(CR) system in the (pure) state
σ =
∣∣ψ〉〈ψ∣∣ ∈ HCR (1)
through a unitary U ∈ HCR ⊗ HCV. The joint den-
sity operator entering the gate is simply the tensor prod-
uct σ ⊗ θ ∈ HCR ⊗HCV so that the standard evolution
through the unitary is given by
EU [σ, θ] = U (σCR ⊗ θCV)U†. (2)

FIG. 2. Quantum circuit formulation of a time-travelling
quantum state. In this model, a (pure) system σ =
∣∣ψ〉〈ψ∣∣
interacts with state θ which is trapped on a CTC formed by
a wormhole. The elastic collision described by the unitary
U can scatter the system state into the future mouth of the
wormhole. When this occurs, the system state evolves along
the CTC and later emerges from the past mouth. From here,
it becomes the second input of the elastic collision, and can
subsequently be scattered into a detectable output state.
One then traces out the CV and CR subsystems sepa-
rately and denotes the resulting maps as
TU

[
U (σ ⊗ θ)U†
]
, (3a)
DU
[
σ, θ
]
≡ trCV
[
U (σ ⊗ θ)U†
]
. (3b)
Self-consistent solution(s) of the CTC state may then be
identified as fixed point(s) of the CTC’s CV map (3a),
which are expressible via
θ = TU
[
σ, θ
]
= trCR
[
U (σ ⊗ θ)U†
]
. (4)
This condition essentially codifies the requirement that
the ‘younger’ CTC state (the right-hand side) exiting the
gate is the same as the ‘older’ CTC state (the left-hand
side) entering the gate. Once solutions to Eq. (4) are
determined, the evolution of the system state σ through
the interaction U in this Deutsch model is then simply
given by Eq. (3b).
The fact that the imposed self-consistency constraint
in (4) is a fixed point condition means that the nonlin-
earity introduced to the laws of quantum mechanics is
distinct from that of other models. Furthermore, as the
rigid matching requirement is for the density matrix as
opposed to the individual states in a pure state decom-
position, the Deutsch model intrinsically treats density
matrices as ontic, ‘real’ objects rather than as epistemic
state representations.
2. Deutsch’s picture: The rule of maximum entropy
Of crucial significance is the fact that the Deutsch pre-
scription resolves time travel paradoxes without placing
any constraints on the input system state. This is be-
cause Deutsch proved that at least one consistent solu-
tion of the map (4) exists for every unitary U and pure σ.
It turns out however that some unitary interactions have
a multiplicity of fixed points, which leads to nondeter-
minism in the time evolution. To resolve this ambiguity,
Deutsch argued that the ‘correct’ solution is the one with
the most von Neumann entropy S, which is defined for
an arbitrary state ρ as
S(ρ) = −tr [ρ ln(ρ)] . (5)

FIG. 3. A quantum circuit formulation of the Ralph and Myers’s iterative method. In this model, the CTC-trapped state
θ(n−1) enters the nth interaction U and exits in the state θ(n).
When formulating this proposition, he appealed to ther-
modynamics (the second law in particular), with his rea-
soning being that the trapped CTC would tend towards
a maximally entropic ‘equilibrium’ state. Given its lack
of rigorous theoretical support however, Deutsch’s rule of
maximum entropy is often considered to be an unsatis-
factory approach to overcoming the problem of plurality
in the CTC state solution.
To overcome this uniqueness ambiguity with a more
rigorous justification, Ralph and Myers introduced their
equivalent circuit version [9, 32–34] of the D-CTC model.
With contributions from Allen [26] and Dong et al. [35],
one can conclude that using the normalised maximally
mixed (identity) initial CTC ‘seed’ state
θ(0) =

yields a state which is convergent to the stable solution
with the most entropy. Here, TkU represents k consecutive
applications of the interaction U . This entire process can
be diagrammatically visualised as per Fig. 3.
Together, the prescription of (6) along with the nor-
malised infinite ‘loop’ map (7) then form a revised ver-
sion of Deutsch’s maximum entropy rule, and it is con-
sidered to be a more appealing condition because it is a
consequence of the theory, unlike Deutsch’s original rule
(which is essentially an educated conjecture).
B. Postselected teleportation
The other main prescription of the quantum mechan-
ics of time travel, postselected teleportation (P-CTCs)
[36, 37], also provides self-consistent resolutions to tem-
poral paradoxes arising from time-travelling quantum
states. The prescription, which is originally based on
a path integral formulation of CTCs by Politzer [38], es-
sentially consists of a quantum communication channel
that is formed through quantum teleportation via posts-
election (see Fig. 4).
The CTC quantum channel is replaced with a maxi-
mally entangled state
∣∣φ〉 (e.g. a Bell state for qubits)
and this allows for states to be transported between a

sender and receiver through shared entanglement. Quan-
tum teleportation further combined with postselection
results in a quantum channel to the past. Time travel
is then produced by entanglement between the forwards
and backwards parts of the curve, and one thus obtains
a possible theoretical description of quantum mechan-
ics near CTCs. Note that the replacement of the CTC
channel with the postselection of a maximally entangled
state is equivalent to a path integral formulation in which
the CTC state’s wave-function evolves in accordance with
self-consistent ‘boundary conditions’ (initial and final co-
ordinates are the same). This is why we say that P-CTCs
has the distinguishing feature of being equivalent to the
path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.
In this prescription, the evolution σ → PU
[

of the
pure system input state is given by

where the relation operator ∼ indicates the pure state
form of the preceding density expression and W =
trCV [U ] is the partial trace over the Hilbert space of the
system in the CTC (with U being the unitary evolution
that couples the CTC to the external system). The non-
linearity in the time evolution indicates that the solutions
are nonunitary, a feature shared by D-CTCs.
C. Comparison
Evidently, these two prescriptions are distinct, yet they
each resolve time travel paradoxes in their own way. P-
CTCs provide unique resolutions whereas D-CTCs re-
quire an adjunct extension (i.e. the rule of maximum en-
tropy [see section II A 2]) in order to mitigate the issue
6
of nonuniqueness. Since both are treatments of inter-
acting quantum systems near CTCs however, we observe
nonunitarity in the evolutions of CR systems in both,
which in turn means that the output states are nonlinear
functions of the input states. In the case of P-CTCs, the
output states remain pure (if initially so) but become un-
normalised (thereby requiring renormalisation), and such
an effect jeopardises the usual probabilistic interpretation
of quantum states. Oppositely, D-CTCs produce entropy
through mixing of the input states. Additionally, another
important difference between the two models is that for
D-CTCs there is no restriction on the initial data, whilst
with P-CTCs, the renormalisation leads to limits on the
initial data as a function of the future.
Nonlinearity is a highly nontrivial issue as its presence
fundamentally changes the structure of the theory. This
is because the standard proofs of many key theorems in
quantum mechanics, which include the no-signalling, no-
cloning, and indistinguishability of nonorthogonal states
theorems, depend on its linearity. Therefore, given the
nonlinearity and nonunitarity of D-CTCs and P-CTCs,
it unsurprising that they have some very interesting ap-
plications. Specifically, both D-CTCs [39] and P-CTCs
[40] have uses in distinguishing nonorthogonal quantum
states, while D-CTCs [41, 42] can clone arbitrary states
and P-CTCs can both signal to the past [9, 43, 44] and
delete arbitrary states. Consequences such as these, in
addition to the possibility that either theory accurately
describes time travel, undeniably motivates further study
into D-CTCs and P-CTCs.
III. MODEL
The indeterminism observed in the billiard ball para-
dox (Fig. 1) is an interesting feature common to time
travel paradoxes in general. Classical problems which in-
clude this feature form an interesting basis for research
when treated quantum mechanically. This then form
the motivation for our study, in which the evolution of
a quantum clock through a circuit which emulates the
self-consistent classical trajectories presented in Fig. 1 is
explored. This makes for a novel model with which D-
CTCs and P-CTCs can be further studied. Specifically,
given the correspondence between P-CTCs and the path
integral formulation, one detail that we are interested
in verifying is if the semiclassical conjecture of Fried-
man et al. in [10] (discussed in the introduction, Sec. I)
agrees with our model’s P-CTCs prescription.
A. Quantum clocks
Classically, a billiard ball possesses no mechanism with
which it can indicate the evolution it underwent through
the CTC region. This is to say that there exists nothing
in its final state which can tell us whether it did or did
not interact with the CTC. To this end, in our quantum
treatment, we introduce an internal degree of freedom
to the billiard ball that, through its evolution, tells us
how much time has passed (in its reference frame). In
other words, we endow the billiard ball with a ‘clock’.
For our purposes, this quantum modification serves to
characterise the difference in proper time between evo-
lutions A and B. Specifically, if this internal degree of
freedom is observable in some manner (e.g. by looking at
the ball’s ‘wristwatch’ upon its emergence from the CTC
region) then, upon measurement, we can deduce which
evolution the particle undertook. Such a modelling of an
internal clock to track a quantum particle’s proper time
was introduced in [45].
For our analysis, we employ the N -level, pure,
equiprobabilistic quantum clock state
∣∣φ〉 = 1√
N
N∑
n=1
∣∣n〉, (9)
where the number states {
∣∣n〉}Nn=1, which obey orthonor-
mality via the condition
〈
m
∣∣n〉 = δ(n −m), collectively
form a basis for the N -dimensional Hilbert space in which
the clock resides. With this, let us define the clock Hamil-
tonian as
Hc =
N∑
n=1
En
∣∣n〉〈n∣∣ (10)
where En is the energy of the nth eigenstate
∣∣n〉. Time
evolution of a state over the times t′ → t′′ is then gener-
ated by the time evolution unitary, which in its standard
form may be written
R(t′′; t′) ≡ R(t′′ − t′) = e− iHc(t
′′−t′)/~ . (11)
Given this form, the evolution of an initial clock state∣∣φ(t)〉 (at time t) to a later state ∣∣φ(t + ∆t)〉 (at time
t+ ∆t) is simply∣∣φ(t+ ∆t)〉 = R(∆t)∣∣φ(t)〉 = e− iHc∆t/~ ∣∣φ(t)〉. (12)
Expanding (11) via a Taylor series and subsequently us-
ing the Hamiltonian expansion (10) allows us to express
an evolved state
∣∣φ(t)〉 in terms of its constituent basis
states {

which quantifies the distinguishability (i.e. coherence) be-
tween the two clock states. Now, given our freedom of
7
choice in specifying the energies without losing generality
or functionality of the clock, we may choose them to be
equally spaced such that
∆E = En − En−1. (15)
Accordingly, the nth energy En can be expressed in terms
of the ground state E1 and the spacing ∆E as
En = E1 + (n− 1)∆E. (16)
From this, we introduce the orthogonalisation time of our
N -level clock, defined as
t⊥ =
2π~
N∆E
, (17)
which represents the minimal time needed for a clock to
evolve (under the now equally spaced Hamiltonian (10))
into an orthogonal one. A system with finite t⊥ can be
thought of as a clock which ‘ticks’ at a rate proportional
to t−1⊥ . Using the form (17) and the energy level relation
(16) allows us to write the clock overlap (14) as
〈
φ(t)
∣∣φ(t+ ∆t)〉 = e− iE1∆t/~
N
N∑
n=1

.
(18)
A point to note is that our clocks, when composed of
equally spaced energy eigenstates as imposed by (16), are
dependent on only two parameters: the time t of their
evolution and the energy E1 of their ground state
∣∣1〉.
Mathematically, this can be shown by using Eqs. (16)
and (17) to express Eq. (13) as
∣∣φ(t)〉 = e− iE1t/~√
N
N∑
n=1
exp
[
−2π i

N

] ∣∣n〉. (19)
In any case, by the series identity
N∑
n=1
rn−1 =
1− rN
1− r
, r 6= 1, (20)
we may write Eq. (18) as
〈
φ(t)
∣∣φ(t+ ∆t)〉 = e− iE1∆t/~
N
1− exp
[
−2π i ∆t
t⊥
]
1− exp
[
−2π i 1
N
∆t

] .
(21)
Evidently, in the case that the evolution time difference
is equal to the orthogonalisation time, i.e. ∆t = t⊥, then
from Eq. (21) it is easy to see that the clock overlap
vanishes, i.e. 〈
φ(t)
∣∣φ(t+ ∆t)〉∣∣
∆t=t⊥
= 0. (22)
The case of ∆t = t⊥ can thus be interpreted as when the
clock’s ‘resolution’ exactly matches the time difference
between the relevant states. This is the key mechanism
with which one can investigate temporal differences be-
tween the multiple trajectories (such as the two paths
in the simple billiard ball paradox) that are generated
via the indeterminism present in spacetimes containing
CTCs.
As a final point, note that the simple forms of the clock
state and its associated Hamiltonian are only convenient
choices—the results we obtain in this paper are com-
pletely independent of them (provided the initial clock
is not an energy eigenstate but is a superposition of dif-
ferent energies). In particular, given that any quantum
system can be decomposed into an orthogonal energy ba-
sis, then our use of such a basis poses no restrictions on
our findings. The use of uniform 1/
√
N weights in the
initial state also merely provides simplicity compared to
that of general amplitudes {cn}Nn=1. In the same vein,
the fact that the energy levels are chosen to be equally
spaced means that the orthogonalisation time is the same
between orthogonal states. Nonequally spaced energies
on the other hand would only prevent the simplification
of the D-CTCs solutions. Indeed, the only consequential
assumption that we make of our clock system is that it
is finite-dimensional, which we justify by assuming that
the clock states must belong in some set of bound states.
B. Quantum circuit model of the billiard ball
paradox
The model which we study in this paper involves the
evolution of the quantum clock state
σ =
∣∣φ〉〈φ∣∣, (23)
along the classical trajectories illustrated in Fig. 1. For
simplicity and rigour, we will work in (1 + 1) dimensions
with a dynamical CTC-wormhole. This means that the
mouths of the wormhole appear and disappear at exactly
the right points in the spacetime to allow our clock to
indeterministically self-interact within the CTC region
given some arbitrary initial velocity. As a result, there
is no need to constrain the paths of the clocks (i.e. with
waveguides) or their initial velocity because the two dis-
tinct histories of our model, depicted in Fig. 5, arise natu-
rally as the only two paths through the spacetime. With
this, we can represent the two evolutions of our clock
in its reference frame through the CTC region as per
Fig. 5, where we denote the proper travel time of the
clock through the wormhole to be exactly ∆t.
Given the trajectories of Fig. 5, it is easy to construct
quantum circuit formulations for the clock states. Such
circuits appear in Fig. 6. Here, the elastic self-collision
of the clock between its past and future selves may be
represented by the SWAP gate
S =
N∑
i,j=1
∣∣i〉〈j∣∣
CR
⊗
∣∣j〉〈i∣∣
CV
. (24)
8
In effect, this exchange of the CV (trapped CTC)
and CR (incoming system) quantum states mimics the
momentum-exchange collision interaction between the
billiard ball’s past and future selves. Next, in order to
combine the two separate subcircuits of Fig. 6 into a sin-
gle model, we introduce a vacuum state
∣∣0〉 (orthonormal
to the existing number states) into both the CR and CV
Hilbert spaces. We mandate that the vacuum and clock
cannot ‘collide’ with each other, and this effect will be
introduced by modifying the SWAP gate to the form
S̃ = 1̃CR ⊗
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣
CV
+
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣
CR
⊗ 1̃CV
−
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣
CR
⊗
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣
CV
+ S (25)
where 1̃ = 1+
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣ is the identity matrix in a vacuum-
inclusive Hilbert space. This altered SWAP simply ex-
cludes the vacuum from swapping with the nonvacuous
states. In this interpretation, the state
∣∣0〉 represents
the physical absence of a clock
∣∣φ〉, hence the ‘vacuum’
nomenclature. In the associated extended Hilbert space,
we write the vacuum-inclusive time evolution unitary as
R̃(t′′ − t′) =
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣+R(t′′ − t′), (26)
where for simplicity we assigned the vacuum with a van-
ishing energy such that its time evolution phase coeffi-
cient is unity. Next, the pure input clock state (9) is
modified to include the vacuum,∣∣φ̃〉 = √Ω∣∣0〉+√1− Ω∣∣φ〉, 0 ≤ Ω ≤ 1, (27)
which obeys the normalisation condition
〈
φ̃
∣∣φ̃〉 = 1 and
can be expressed in a density form as
σ̃ =
∣∣φ̃〉〈φ̃∣∣. (28)
Given the results from the preliminary analyses of the
circuits in the previous section, we can, without loss of
generality, set for simplicity the inbound and outbound
times both equal to zero, i.e.
tin = tout = 0 (29)
for all subsequent analysis. This means that a clock
which does not interact with the CTC will not time evolve
while one which does interact will time evolve (by the
CTC ‘duration’ ∆t). With this in mind, we may depict
our billiard ball paradox circuit model as per Fig. 7.
With the altered SWAP gate (25), the vacuum-modified
unitary corresponding to the circuit in Fig. 7 is simply
Ũ =
[
1̃CR ⊗ R̃CV(∆t)
]
· S̃. (30)
The effect of this vacuum model is to provide the clock
state with the possibility of not interacting with the CTC
if the trapped state is in the vacuum (hence the ‘vacuum’
nomenclature, as the associated state represents the ab-
sence of a clock). With this, the input state may either
self-consistently interact with the CTC or it may pass
straight through the circuit, thus allowing it to evolve
through the circuit in the two paths of Fig. 1.

FIG. 5. Based on the simple billiard ball paradox in Fig. 1,
these diagrams in 1 + 1 spacetime visualise the basic idea of
the model under study in reference frame of the clock. (a)
illustrates the history where the clock travels through the
CTC-wormhole region with no interaction, while (b) shows
the history of a clock which elastically interacts with itself.
The times as measured by the clocks at specific points along
the histories are given in brackets next to their analogue clock
symbols. These clocks begin at time t = 0 and, due to their
initial velocity, measure the proper times tA = tin + tout and
tB = tin + ∆t+ tout = tA + ∆t for evolutions A and B respec-
tively. This means that we denote the duration of the segment
on the CTC in evolution B to be ∆t, while the inbound and
outbound times to and from the wormhole axis (dashed line)
are tin and tout respectively.

IV. RESULTS
A. N-level general clocks
Here we present the general analyses of the model using
the N -level clocks introduced in Sec. III A.
1. D-CTCs results
With the unitary (30), CV fixed points present them-
selves as solutions to the equation
θ̃ =

1− |Ω|2
) 〈

(31)
By direct substitution, one can verify that a solution ex-
ists in the form
TŨ [σ̃, θ̃](∆t,Ω, g) = g
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣
+ (1− g)
(1− Ω)
Ω
∞∑
n=1
Ωnσ(n)(∆t),
(32)
where σ(n)(∆t) is defined by the conventions
Rn(t′′ − t′)
∣∣φ〉 ≡ ∣∣φ(n)(t′′ − t′)〉, (33)∣∣φ(n)(t′′ − t′)〉〈φ(n)(t′′ − t′)∣∣ ≡ σ(n)(t′′ − t′). (34)
On this result, firstly note the presence of the free param-
eter 0 ≤ g ≤ 1, which indicates an infinite multiplicity
in the set of solutions. Also observe how such solutions
consist of the classical sum of the vacuum and an infi-
nite series of clock states at different evolutionary times.
This spectrum of clock CTC ‘windings’ are weighted by
the input vacuum coefficient Ω such that, in the case of
Ω < 1, higher-order windings have lesser probability to
be trapped within the CTC.
In terms of the equivalent circuit model, it is easy to
analytically verify that these solutions correspond to the
seed state
θ̃(0)(g) = g
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣+ (1− g)ρ, (35)
i.e. an infinite number of applications of the unitary
(30) to this CV state with the input CR state (27) con-
verges to the solution (32). Here, ρ is an arbitrary nor-
malised state existing in the clock subspace. In accor-
dance with the revised Deutsch’s rule of maximum en-
tropy (see Sec. II A 2), we choose the stable fixed point
with maximal entropy given by the definition (5). In the
equivalent circuit picture, this occurs to when the seed
state is maximally mixed. Given that the fixed point is
independent of ρ (its presence merely generates clocks
within the CTC), we can choose ρ = 1
N
1 without loss of
generality, and subsequently calculate the entropy to be
S[θ̃(0)] = −g ln(g)− (1− g) ln
(
1− g
N
)
. (36)
This is maximised when
∂S[θ̃(0)]
∂g
= 0 =⇒ g =
1
N + 1
, (37)
and the corresponding seed state is of course then simply
θ̃(0)(g)
∣∣∣
g= 1
N+1
=
1
N + 1
1̃, (38)
as prescribed by the equivalent circuit method (6). In
our subsequent analysis, we will retain the multiplicity
parameter g in order to both simplify the notation and
track its effect through the calculations.
The D-CTCs output state corresponding to the fixed
point (32) is found to be
DŨ [σ̃, θ̃](∆t,Ω, g) = gσ̃ + (1− g)
(1− Ω)

(39)
where we used
〈
φ(0)
∣∣φ(n)(∆t)〉 = tr[Rn(∆t)]
N
. (40)
Let us now analyse these results. First, it is easy to
analytically verify that the state populations are constant
10
with respect to ∆t, and in fact take the values
〈
k
∣∣TŨ ∣∣k〉 =
{
g, k = 0,

(41)
〈

∣∣DŨ ∣∣k〉 =
{
Ω, k = 0,

N
(1− Ω) , k > 0.
(42)
These results tell us the parameter g directly controls the
mixing between vacuous and nonvacuous levels for the
CV trapped state while Ω has exactly the same effect on
the CR output state.
Next, we can compute the probabilities of measuring
unevolved and orthogonal clocks in both D-CTCs states
to be

N2
, (44b)
where we used the fact that
0 =
〈
φ(0)
∣∣φ(t⊥)〉 = tr[R(t⊥)]
N
. (45)
These quantities tell us the relative likelihoods of detect-
ing either type of clock trapped within the CTC or exiting
the CTC region. From them, we deduce the relations〈
φ(0)
∣∣DŨ ∣∣φ(0)〉 = g + (1− Ω)〈φ(0)∣∣TŨ ∣∣φ(0)〉, (46)〈
φ(t⊥)
∣∣DŨ ∣∣φ(t⊥)〉 = (1− Ω)〈φ(t⊥)∣∣TŨ ∣∣φ(t⊥)〉, (47)
with which we infer that the D-CTCs trapped and output
state clock probabilities are related linearly with respect
to ∆t.
2. P-CTCs results
According to P-CTCs, to find the output state we first
must trace out the CV channel from the unitary (30),
which yields
W̃ ≡ trCV[Ũ ] = tr[R̃(∆t)]
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣+ 1+R(∆t). (48)
With this, the output in pure state form is simply
PŨ

(∆t,Ω) =

{
√
Ω tr[R̃(∆t)]
∣∣0〉+√1− Ω[∣∣φ(0)〉+ ∣∣φ(∆t)〉]
}
(49)
where the normalisation constant N is given by
N = tr[W̃ σ̃W̃ †]
= Ω tr[R̃(∆t)]tr[R̃†(∆t)]
+ (1− Ω)
(
2 +
tr[R(∆t)] + tr[R†(∆t)]
N
)
. (50)
The corresponding state populations are
〈
k
∣∣PŨ ∣∣k〉 = 1N ×
{
Ω tr[R̃(∆t)]tr[R̃†(∆t)], k = 0,
(1− Ω) |1 +Rkk(∆t)|
2
, k > 0.
(51)
Unlike the D-CTCs populations in Eqs. (41) and (42),
we observe that these expressions are not simply ∆t-
independent constants in P-CTCs. Lastly, we can com-
11
pute the clock probabilities to be
〈
φ(0)
∣∣PŨ ∣∣φ(0)〉 = 1N (1− Ω)
∣∣∣∣1 + tr[R(∆t)]N
∣∣∣∣2 ,
(52a)〈
φ(t⊥)
∣∣PŨ ∣∣φ(t⊥)〉 = 1N (1− Ω)
∣∣∣∣ tr[R†(t⊥)R(∆t)]N
∣∣∣∣2 .
(52b)
B. 2-level qubit clocks
To further comprehend the results of the previous sec-
tion, we can employ numerical methods to generate visu-
alisations of the various quantities. For simplicity, these
plots can be produced by employing qubit (i.e. N = 2
dimensions) quantum clock states,
∣∣φ(0)〉 = 1√
2
(∣∣1〉+ ∣∣2〉) , (53)
where
∣∣1〉 and ∣∣2〉 are the ground and excited states re-
spectively. By Eqs. (16) and (17), the associated clock
gate may be written as
R(∆t) = e− iE1∆t/~
(∣∣1〉〈1∣∣+ e− iπ∆t/t⊥ ∣∣2〉〈2∣∣) , (54)
so that the orthogonalisation time ∆t = t⊥ transforms
the initial clock qubit (53) into the orthogonal state
∣∣φ(t⊥)〉 = R(t⊥)∣∣φ(0)〉 = e− iE1t⊥/~√
2
(∣∣1〉− ∣∣2〉) . (55)
Importantly, note that qubit clocks only have 2 mutually
orthogonal states, which means that multiple loops of the
CTC (such as those described the clock spectrums of 32
and 39) cannot be captured by such clocks.
The quantities of interest which we will visualise in-
clude the energy level populations (of the
∣∣0〉, ∣∣1〉 and∣∣2〉 states) and clock probabilities (both the unevolved∣∣φ(0)〉 and orthogonal ∣∣φ(t⊥)〉 clocks). From these di-
agrams, we can discern the behaviours of the vacuum
model in terms of both D-CTCs and P-CTCs. Note that
all of our D-CTCs plots will use g = 1
3
in accordance
with the rule of maximal entropy (37).
1. D-CTCs qubit visualisations
By employing qubit clocks, it is easy to plot the
trapped (43) and output (44) probabilities, and such vi-
sualisations appear respectively in Figs. 8 and 9. For
both the CV and CR systems, these plots depicts the
transition from constant probability profiles (Ω = 1) to
curved ones (Ω < 1), where the trough and peak be-
haviours become more pronounced as Ω → 0. For the

CV probabilities, an interesting feature is that while they
are both exactly 1
3
(which corresponds to the maximally
entropic selection of g for our qubit clocks) for Ω = 1, any
infinitesimal variation of Ω below 1 results in the prob-
abilities jumping discontinuously to assume their curved
behaviours. This indicates that the spectrum of clocks
at differing rotation (as per the series in Eq. (32)) mate-
rialises inside the CTC as soon as Ω varies from 1.
2. P-CTCs qubit visualisations
Qubit plots, appearing in Fig. 10, serve to illustrate the
behaviour of the P-CTCs populations (51) in terms of Ω
and ∆t. Note the symmetry about the orthogonalisation
time ∆t = t⊥ and that summation to 1 is preserved for
all Ω and ∆t (as expected). Also note how as Ω → 1,

Next, the clock probabilities (52) are visualised in
Fig. 11. Of interest is the fact that these probabilities
behave in the same manner as the CR output from the
D-CTCs analysis of Fig. 9 barring three relatively small
differences. The first two of these differences is that the
P-CTCs troughs (for the unevolved clock) and peaks (for
the orthogonal clock) are both narrower and reach the
same extrema (which occur at orthogonalisation). The
third and perhaps most interesting difference is that the
unevolved clock curves display a kind of behaviour in-
version as Ω varies. Beginning initially with trough-like
profiles at small Ω, the lines transition into symmetric
peaks (albeit small) at large Ω (e.g.
√
Ω = 0.8), until
they finally flatten out at Ω = 1.
V. DISCUSSION
Evidently, our quantum circuit model produces non-
trivial results in terms of D-CTCs and P-CTCs. Here,
we highlight some interesting features of the results, com-
pare the two prescriptions, discuss the effects of the pa-
rameters g, Ω and ∆t, and conclude with some general
remarks.
The form of the D-CTCs trapped state becomes intu-
itive in the equivalent circuit picture. Provided the mul-

a mixture of the vacuum and clock energy levels. With
this, in each iteration through the circuit (i.e. application
of the unitary (30)), the nonvacuous portion of the CTC
state (initially (1−g) 1
N
1) effectively ‘catches’ a unevolved
clock from the input state into the CTC. Any existing
nonvacuous states inside the CTC are then multiplied by
the probability that the CR state is vacuous, i.e. Ω, which
corresponds to the chance that the trapped clock(s) will
be unable to leave the CTC. Lastly, everything inside
the CTC time evolves, i.e. rotates by the time delay ∆t.
After an infinite number of interations, we end up with
the infinite spectrum of clocks (1− g)
∑∞
n=1 Ω
nσ(n)(∆t),
which after normalisation by (1−Ω)/Ω and the addition
of the unchanged vacuum portion g
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣, leaves us with
our CV solution (32).
The D-CTCs CR output state is then simple to inter-
pret. The vacuous CV component allows for input CR
clocks to pass through the circuit unaffected, while the
spectrum of trapped clocks swaps with the input clock
and combines with the input vacuum in the CR out-
put. Note that if the tr[Rn(∆t)]/N and tr[R†n(∆t)]/N
factors in the output (39) were unity, then the infi-
nite series term would reduce to the vacuum-clock spec-
trum
∑∞
n=1 Ω
nσ̃(n)(∆t). This of course only occurs when
∆t = mNt⊥ (m ∈ Z>0) however, which is the case where
the spectrum disappears due to complete revolution of
the clock.
Conversely, the P-CTCs output (49) is, excluding the
single pure vacuum state, a simple superposition of the
unevolved and singly evolved clocks states. This is in
stark contrast with the spectrum of higher-order wind-
ings in D-CTCs associated with 0 < Ω < 1. It is only in
the case that Ω = 0 where the D-CTCs output reduces
to a classical mixture of the unevolved and singly evolved
clock superposition, i.e.
√
g
∣∣φ(0)〉±√1− g∣∣φ(∆t)〉.
A. Effects of the various circuit parameters
1. The effect of the multiplicity parameter g
When solving the D-CTCs conditions (3) analytically
for our vacuum model, a degree of freedom g inescapably
arose in the solutions to the CV trapped state (32). It
became apparent that this quantity emerged out of neces-
sity as a way to characterise the circuit’s inherent multi-
plicity of solutions. In particular, it was determined that
g continuously parametrises the CV solutions, thereby
meaning that the trapped state has an infinite set of
solutions. As a consequence, the solution multiplicity
characterised by g propagates through to the CR out-
put states (39), yielding a solution set which is likewise
dependent on g.
The D-CTCs prescription of our circuit is then not
extraordinary in that it exhibits solution multiplicity,
a feature which is distinctive of Deutsch’s model itself.
One then sets out to resolve the multiplicity in accor-
dance with the model: finding the value of g where the
CV trapped state is both maximally entropic and sta-
ble. This is accomplished via the equivalent circuit model
(see Sec. II A 2), wherein one begins with the maximally
mixed seed state and evolves it through the circuit an
infinite number of times. We observe that the value of
g = 1/(N + 1) (where N is the number of clock energy
levels) corresponds to our desired maximally entropic CV
solution. More generally however, we notice that a seed
state (35) consisting of skewed mixture (controlled by g)
of the vacuum and nonvacuous energy levels converges
to the g-dependent set of solutions originally computed.
This is because the separate components in the end state
fixed point are linear transformations of the input com-
ponents of the seed state, which consequently means that
the initial mixture of the seed state directly controls the
form of the CV state. Of interest is the fact that level
populations of the initial seed state correspond exactly to
those of the CV state (41), which encapsulates the effect
that g and therefore the multiplicity have on the trapped
state.
In terms of clocks and vacuum prescription of our cir-
cuit, its behaviour with regards to g is both simple and
intuitive. It is easy to see that the vacuous part of the CV
mixture (32), accompanied by its probability g, directly
controls the density of unevolved clock (corresponding to
evolution A) in the CR output (39). This is physically
intuitive as when the CTC is vacuous, incoming clocks
are unable to interact with it (and consequently time
evolve), leaving them unevolved. Conversely, the comple-
ment probability 1− g governs the proportion of evolved
clocks in the CV state mixture and therefore the likeli-
hood of observing either the vacuum or an evolved clock
in the CR output. In essence, the multiplicity parame-
ter g stems from the initial mixture of the CV seed state
and consequently sets the structure of the CV trapped
and CR output states in terms of clocks (both unevolved
and evolved) and the vacuum.
2. The effect of the vacuum parameter Ω
Unlike the multiplicity parameter g, the vacuum input
amplitude
√
Ω influences the results of both D-CTCs and
P-CTCs. In the former, its presence causes any nonva-
cuous components of the CV state to loop around the
CTC upon interaction with the CR state. However, in
P-CTCs its effect is trivial in that, due to the necessary
renormalisation, it merely controls the relative amplitude
between the vacuum and clock levels in the output state.
Consider the case where Ω = 0, corresponding to when
the input state consists of only the clock (and no vac-
uum). Here, the D-CTCs and P-CTCs states reduce to
TŨ

σ̃, θ̃

∼
∣∣φ(0)〉+ ∣∣φ(∆t)〉√∣∣∣2 + tr[R(∆t)]+tr[R†(∆t)]N ∣∣∣
. (57)
Of importance is the fact that the D-CTCs states no
longer contain clocks of rotation order higher than 1.
This is due to the fact that by setting Ω = 0, we re-
move the sole mechanism with which clock states cannot
swap out of the CTC, thereby eliminating any eternally
trapped clocks. As a consequence, the D-CTCs CV state
becomes simply a classical mixture of the vacuum and
the singly evolved clock, which has a direct interpreta-
tion as describing a CTC either containing nothing or a
clock respectively. These two classical alternatives then
directly specify what occurs within the CTC region. In
the former, where there is probability g that that there
is no clock in the CTC, and so there is an equal probabil-
ity of the external clock not interacting with the CTC.
Hence, the output clock
∣∣φ(0)〉 must have followed the
classical evolution A. Alternatively, in the latter case,
a clock was in the CTC with a complement probability
1− g. This can only happen if the initial clock was scat-
tered into it, which means that the evolved clock (which
was kicked out by its younger self) takes on the form∣∣φ(∆t)〉 in accordance with the classical trajectory B.
At the other extreme case, Ω = 1, all states in both
quantum descriptions are purely vacuous, i.e.
TŨ
[
σ̃, θ̃
]∣∣∣
Ω=1
=
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣, (58a)
DŨ

Ω=1
=
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣; (58b)
PŨ
[
σ̃
]∣∣
Ω=1
=
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣. (59)
This is perhaps what might intuitively expect as when
only the vacuum (Ω = 1) is used as input, all states in
both prescriptions cannot be anything but vacuous.
These two cases highlight an interesting feature of our
model which is particularly apparent in D-CTCs. Here,
the presence of the vacuum in the trapped state is of
course independent of the input vacuum coefficient Ω.
Since the vacuum is unable to be exchanged across the
quantum channels given our modified SWAP gate, then its
manifestation on the CV channel can only be caused by
the extension of the CV channel’s Hilbert space (which
initially consists of only the clock subspace) to include
the vacuum subspace. This also occurs in P-CTCs in
much the same way as, although we are unable to define
a CTC state, the indeterministic interaction of the clock
with the CTC that we observe is only possible if the CTC
has a vacuous component.
3. The effect of the CTC time delay ∆t
The phase rotation of the CTC, denoted as ∆t and in-
terpreted as the CTC’s time delay, yields which-way in-
formation and thus distinguish the two classical histories
of the billiard ball paradox. Its influences on the solu-
tions are fairly intuitive and simple. To examine these
effects further, we will look at a few important cases.
Firstly, when ∆t = 0, one can interpret the CTC as
having a vanishingly short length. As a result, the two
histories of the billiard ball paradox become, at no fault
of our clock, indistinguishable in the sense that the clock
does not time evolve during its history through the cir-
cuit. The associated states are therefore
TŨ

. (61)
For the P-CTCs state, note the linear dependence of the
vacuum component’s amplitude on the clock’s dimension
N . This indicates that as the dimensions become more
numerous, the probability of measuring a clock in the
output becomes smaller, thereby amplifying the vacuum.
Conversely, in the case of ∆t = t⊥, we can use the fact
that R(t⊥) = 1 to write the solutions as

. (63)

Here, the D-CTCs clock spectrum of the general ∆t case
(32), which consists of (possibly) an infinite number of
distinctly rotated clocks
{
Rn(∆t)
∣∣φ〉}∞
n=1
, reduces to the
spectrum of N orthogonal clocks
{
Rn(t⊥)
∣∣φ〉}N
n=1
. In re-
gards to the original billiard ball paradox, we associate
the zeroth orthogonal state
∣∣φ(0)〉 = R0(t⊥)∣∣φ〉 with
evolution A, and the first orthogonal clock
∣∣φ(t⊥)〉 =
R1(t⊥)
∣∣φ〉 with evolution B. The existence of higher-
order rotations (i.e. clock windings of the CTC) in D-
CTCs merely indicates the entrapment of these states
inside the CTC by the external (CR) vacuum. These
vanish when the input vacuum amplitude is extremised,
i.e. Ω = 0 or Ω = 1.
The importance of the time delay ∆t and its relation-
ship with the orthogonalisation time t⊥ become apparent
in a physical interpretation of the model. By construc-
tion, our clocks have an intrinsic time between ‘ticks’
which we denote t⊥. Our N -level clocks have N such
ticks, or times that we are able to perfectly distinguish
between via measurement. This is due to the fact that the
only clock states which have vanishing mutual overlaps
are those which form the mutually orthogonal clock set.
The probabilistic interpretation of our model then leads
us to conclude that any clock not in this set will exist
in a superposition of orthogonal clocks (i.e. those which
are in the set). For example, a clock which has evolved
in a nonorthogonal manner possesses a time between two
adjacent ticks and consequently would have a chance to
be in either of the two tick states upon measurement.
Cunning construction of the input clock, such that its
orthogonalisation time exactly matches the CTC time de-
lay, yields solutions which consist of clock states that are
perfectly distinguishable. As such states correspond to
the respective number of times the clock passed through
the CTC, we are able to, due to the clock’s configuration,
extract precise which-way information from the output
states.
4. Special case
Here, we consider perhaps the most enlightening spe-
cial case of our model. By mandating that we always
send in a clock into the circuit (Ω = 0) whilst ensuring
that the CTC’s time delay matches the clock’s orthog-
onalisation time exactly (∆t = t⊥), the output states
become
TŨ

Ω=0

2
[∣∣φ(0)〉+ ∣∣φ(t⊥)〉] . (65)
Note that the D-CTCs CR output is a classical mixture
of the evolved and unevolved clocks, while the P-CTCs
output is an equiprobabilistic superposition of the very
same clocks. In fact, given that the postselected telepor-
tation model is equivalent to a path integral formulation,
our circuit appears to have faithfully reproduced the orig-
inal conjecture of Friedman et al. (concerning the WKB
approximation of the billiard ball paradox) in Ref. [10].
B. P-CTCs constraints on initial data
One interesting general characteristic of P-CTCs is
that it can pose constraints on initial conditions. Due
to the renormalisation, such constraints depend on the
future of the time-travelling state. Here, we explicitly
demonstrate the restrictions associated with the P-CTCs
description of our circuit.
Given our N -level clock (9), there exists exactly N mu-
tually orthogonal, equally spaced states {
∣∣φ(n)(t⊥)〉}N−1n=0
which it can assume. As a consequence, one may express
the clock gate (11) in terms of the ground state energy
E1 defined via (16) as
R(t′′ − t′) = e− iE1(t
′′−t′)/~
×
N∑
k=1
exp
[
−2π i
k − 1
N
t′′ − t′
t⊥
] ∣∣k〉〈k∣∣.
(66)
From this, it is easy to conclude that
RN (t⊥) = e
− iNE1t⊥/~ 1, (67)
which simply indicates that N orthogonal rotations of the
clock brings it back to its initial state (up to the global
phase e− iNE1t⊥/~). This therefore means that a clock∣∣φ〉 which orthogonalises m ∈ Z>0 times accumulates m
such phases, i.e.
RmN (t⊥)
∣∣φ〉 = e− imNE1t⊥/~ ∣∣φ〉. (68)
Judicious choice of our clock’s orthogonalisation time t⊥
such that it is related to the CTC time delay ∆t by
∆t = mNt⊥, m ∈ Z>0, (69)
means that a clock which completes one journey on the
CTC would orthogonally evolve m times. In such a case,
the P-CTCs reduced operator (48) becomes
W̃
∣∣∣
∆t=mNt⊥
=
(
1 +N e− imNE1t⊥/~
) ∣∣0〉〈0∣∣
+
(
1 + e− imNE1t⊥/~
)
1. (70)
Additionally, if we construct our clock so that its ground
state energy E1 satisfies
E1 =
π~
mNt⊥
(1 + 2p), p ∈ Z≥0, (71)
16
then the operator (70) further reduces to
W̃ ′ = W̃
∣∣∣ ∆t=mNt⊥
E1=
π~
mNt⊥
(1+2p)
= (1−N)
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣. (72)
After renormalisation, the corresponding P-CTCs output
is then of course simply the vacuum density, i.e.
∣∣0〉〈0∣∣.
But where did our clock go?
To answer this question, we can use the entangled state
∣∣ψ〉
rec,CR

√
2
[∣∣0〉
rec
⊗
∣∣0〉
CR
+
∣∣φ(0)〉

∣∣φ(0)〉
CR
]
(73)
as input to our circuit. Here, the state existing in the
first Hilbert space may be interpreted as a record of what
we send into the second, CR channel. With this entan-
glement, we find the P-CTCs unnormalised pure state
output, corresponding to our circuit’s ordinary operator
1̃rec ⊗ W̃CR from (48), to be
(
1̃rec ⊗ W̃CR
) ∣∣ψ〉

1− Ω
∣∣φ(0)〉
rec
⊗
[∣∣φ(0)〉
CR
+
∣∣φ(∆t)〉
CR
]
. (74)
The persistence of the entanglement means that when the
record indicates that we did not send in a clock, we will
not observe a clock in the CR output. Conversely, when
we definitely did send in a clock, we must observe a clock
exiting the CTC region which is exactly what one would
expect intuitively. However, under the conditions (69)
and (71) which yield the operator (72), the entanglement
of our input state (73) breaks,(
1̃rec ⊗ W̃ ′CR
) ∣∣ψ〉
rec,CR
∝
∣∣0〉
rec
⊗
∣∣0〉
CR
. (75)
The mere presence of the interaction with the CTC in
the future implies that the record channel will show that
no clock was ever prepared, even though the initial state
(73) included the possibility that a clock was there (which
would show up in the record if the future interaction with
the CTC was avoided.
Given the path integral correspondence of P-CTCs,
then the conditions (69) and (71) collectively form a case
in which no clocks can evolve through the circuit due
to destructive interference in the path integral. This is
to say that P-CTCs suppress all evolutions of nonvacu-
ous states as a result of the particular future evolution
of clock states in our model, thereby posing constraints
on the initial state. This issue highlights the well-known
problem of antichronological and superluminal influence
with P-CTCs [9, 43, 44]. In contrast, the initial data for
D-CTCs is never affected by the presence or absence of
the CTC in the future.
C. Other remarks
1. On the restricted set of classical trajectories
Perhaps the most significant physical approximation
(and limitation) in our model is that we insist on classi-
cal trajectories (i.e. only the 2 of the simple billiard ball
paradox in Fig. 1). It is possible, and even likely, that
a model consisting of a less restrictive set of trajectories
would possess significantly different and nontrivial solu-
tions in terms of both D-CTCs and P-CTCs. Neverthe-
less, the manifestation of higher-order CTC clock wind-
ings in the D-CTCs solutions to our rather simple circuit
is an interesting result, particularly given the absence of
any explicit modelling of CTC multiple loop trajectories.
2. On the initial trapped state
In ordinary quantum mechanics, any mixed state can
be purified in an enlarged Hilbert space through the use
of an ancillary system. In the Deutsch model however,
purification of the CTC bound state is not possible since
it has to be in a proper mixture (i.e. it can not be a sub-
system of a pure entangled state) [46]. The very power
of the prescription lies in the fact that it allows for the
information trapped within the CTC to exist in a mixed
state, and it is this distinguishing feature which enables
it to solve classically paradoxical problems.
As a consequence, we might question where the mixed-
ness in the trapped state comes from. One might argue
that the interaction with the CR state is the source, but
this requires a cause-effect understanding of the problem
which is of course not possible for time travel paradoxes.
The fact that we can describe the interaction narrative
not as sequential history (with a beginning and end) but
as a closed loop means that there is no beginning of the
existence of the bound CTC state. From this, we can
conclude that it is simply information trapped within a
closed loop and therefore it simply exists uncaused.
A motivating question now is how the trapped state
comes into existence when it is, and always has been,
isolated from the universe. Deutsch permits a time ma-
chine created at an arbitrarily distant time in the past to
interact with any system and resolve any paradox which
it comes across in its future, which means that it must
contain the necessary state trapped within itself to do
17
so. Given that it is able to interact with an arbitrar-
ily large number of external systems in its entire history,
then it potentially could possess an equivalent number
of distinct trapped states. In the interpretation that our
quantum clocks are formed by energy eigenstates, then
the fact that the trapped state could contain clock(s) at
any temporal evolution which exist in an arbitrarily large
Hilbert space means that the ‘temperature’ of the time
machines may potentially have no bound. Another prob-
lem too is then how, at the creation of the time machine,
its ‘temperature’ and any trapped states are initialised.
An at least partial solution to this problem comes from
the equivalent circuit picture, wherein we saw that an
initial trapped state which is not a function of the input
can evolve over many iterations into the correct trapped
state.
Another possible way to resolve this potentially dis-
turbing problem is to reiterate the fact that the trapped
state is inaccessible to everything except the state which
would interact with the time machine in a paradoxical
fashion. We are simply unable to observe (i.e. measure)
the CTC state without changing it. In this sense, the CV
channel acts like a parallel universe, and paradoxes are
resolved by the trapped state ‘transforming’ into what-
ever it needs to be. Given that the ‘temperature’ of the
time machine is contributed to by its trapped state, then
our own universe is completely unaffected by this state
up to its paradox-resolving capabilities. One might then
even take the viewpoint that we should not care what is
bound within the time machine, or that the CTC channel
connects to a parallel universe.
Conversely, P-CTCs do not have problems regarding
trapped states as one is unable to define such states
in the prescription. In this regard, it might appear to
be a more attractive theory, given all of the interpreta-
tional and philosophical problems with D-CTCs and the
trapped states. However, as discussed in the previous
section (Sec. V B), the problem of superluminal influence
(and the associated constraints on initial data) remains
an issue for P-CTCs.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a novel quantum circuit
formulation of the billiard ball paradox. Our model is
based on two important mechanisms. The first, which
involves the incorporation of an internal degree of free-
dom into the billiard ball, allows it to effectively function
like a clock. In practice, this meant that we were able to
measure the proper time of the distinct classical evolu-
tions A and B, from which we could extract which-way
information (distinguishability) regarding these trajecto-
ries. The second mechanism is that of the vacuum state,
which allowed the clock to either travel unperturbed (if
there is nothing, i.e. vacuum, in the CTC) or be scattered
into the CTC (if there is the external clock’s trapped fu-
ture self already inside).
We found that the D-CTC model reproduces the mul-
tiplicity of solutions present in the classical case, and we
discussed how this multiplicity can be naturally inter-
preted in terms of a choice of ‘initial state’ (parametrised
by g) in the D-CTC. On the other hand, the P-CTC
model presents only one quantum state as a solution,
which takes the form of a pure superposition of the clock
having evolved and not evolved through the CTC (with
the possible addition of a vacuum component if such a
state was initially sent in with the clock). This therefore
reproduces the intuition expressed by Friedman et al. in
their seminal paper [10] (discussed in the latter part of
the introduction and in Sec. V A 4).
Our results demonstrated that when one prescribes the
existence of a vacuum, the D-CTCs and P-CTCs output
states become the aforementioned mixture and superpo-
sition respectively of the histories which do and do not
interact with the CTC. These outcomes thus support the
notion that if the world operates in accordance with D-
CTCs then the classical picture one gets works like mul-
tiple universes, otherwise if it operates as per P-CTCs
then there are constraints on the actions which one is
able to perform.
The framework of incorporating quantum clocks into
classical particles that evolve along wholly classical tra-
jectories allowed us to rigorously explore the billiard ball
paradox. Purely using our clock methodology, were able
to quantitatively examine the mechanisms of both D-
CTCs and P-CTCs. Albeit simple, its ability to allow
one to distinguish between multiple histories through a
chronology violating region is a powerful function of the
framework, and one could of course use it to very easily
study other time travel paradoxes.

Coulomb electron pairing in a tight-binding model of
La-based cuprate superconductors
K. M. Frahm,1 and D. L. Shepelyansky1,∗
We study the properties of two electrons with Coulomb
interactions in a tight-binding model of La-based
cuprate superconductors. This tight-binding model is
characterized by long-range hopping obtained previ-
ously by advanced quantum chemistry computations.
We show analytically and numerically that the Coulomb
repulsion leads to a formation of compact pairs prop-
agating through the whole system. The mechanism of
pair formation is related to the emergence of an effec-
tive narrow energy band for Coulomb electron pairs
with conserved total pair energy and momentum. The
dependence of the pair formation probability on an ef-
fective filling factor is obtained with a maximum around
a filling factor of 20 (or 80) percent. The comparison
with the case of the nearest neighbor tight-binding
model shows that the long-range hopping provides
an increase of the phase space volume with high pair
formation probability. We conjecture that the Coulomb
electron pairs discussed here may play a role in high
temperature superconductivity.
1 Introduction
The phenomenon of high temperature superconductiv-
ity (HTC), discovered in [1], still requires its detailed phys-
ical understanding as discussed by various experts of
this field (see e.g. [2–4]). The analysis is complicated by
the complexity of the phase diagram and strong interac-
tions between electrons (or holes). As a generic model,
that can be used for a description of most supercon-
ducting cuprates, it was proposed to use a simplified
one-body Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor hopping
on a square lattice formed by the Cu ions [5]. In addi-
tion the interactions between electrons are considered
as a strongly screened Coulomb interaction that results
in the 2D Hubbard model [5]. However, a variety of ex-
perimental results cannot be described by the 2D Hub-
bard model (see e.g. discussion in [6]). Other models of
type Emery [7–10] were developed and extended on the
basis of extensive computations with various numerical
methods of quantum chemistry (see e.g. [6, 11] and Refs.
therein). These studies demonstrated the importance of
next-nearest hopping and allowed to determine reliably
the longer-ranged tight-binding parameters.
In this work we use the 2D longer-ranged tight-binding
parameters reported in [6] and study the effects of Coulomb
interactions between electrons in the frame work of this
tight-binding model. There are different reasons indicat-
ing that long-range interactions between electrons may
lead to certain new features as compared to the Hub-
bard case (see [3, 4, 6]). Recently, we demonstrated that
for two electrons on a 2D lattice with nearest-neighbor
hopping the energy and momentum conservation laws
leads to appearance of an effective narrow energy band
for energy dispersion of two electrons [12]. In such a nar-
row band even a repulsive Coulomb interaction leads to
electron pairing and ballistic propagation of such pairs
through the whole system. The internal classical dynam-
ics of electrons inside such a pair is chaotic suggesting
nontrivial properties of pair formation in the quantum
case. In this work we extend the investigations of the
properties of such Coulomb electron pairs for a more
generic longer-ranged tight-binding lattice of one-body
Hamiltonian typical for La-based cuprate superconduc-
tors. We find that the long-range hopping leads to new
features of Coulomb electron pairs.
In Sec. 2 a detailed description of the tight-binding
model for two interacting electrons for general lattices
with a particular application to HTC is presented to-
gether with an analysis of the effective band width at
fixed conserved total pair momentum. Section 3 provides
first results of the full space time evolution obtained in
the frame work of the Trotter formula approximation.

Section 4 introduces the theoretical basis for the descrip-
tion in terms of an effective block Hamiltonian for a given
sector of fixed momentum of a pair with technical de-
tails provided in Appendix A. In Sec. 5 the phase diagram
of the long time average of the pair formation probabil-
ity in the plane of total momentum is discussed while
Sec. 6 provides some results for the intermediate time
evolution of pair formation. An overview of the results for
the pair formation probability at different filling factors
is given in Section 7. The final discussion is presented in
Section 8.
2 Generalized tight-binding model on a
2D lattice
We assume that each electron moves on a square lattice
of size N × N with periodic boundary conditions with
respect to the following generalized one-particle tight-
binding Hamiltonian:
H1p =−
∑
r
∑
a∈A
ta
(
|r〉〈r+a|+ |r+a〉〈r|
)
(1)
where the first sum is over all discrete lattice points r
(measured in units of the lattice constant) and a belongs
to a certain set of neighbor vectors A such that for each
lattice state |r〉 there are non-vanishing hopping matrix
elements ta with |r+a〉 and |r−a〉 for a ∈ A . To be more
precise, due to notational reasons, we choose the set A
to contain all neighbor vectors a = (ax , ay ) in one half
plane with either ax > 0 or ay > 0 if ax = 0 such that
A
′
= A ∪ (−A ) is the full set of all neighbor vectors. For
each vector a of the full set A ′, we require that any other
vector ã which can be obtained from a by a reflection at
either the x-axis, y-axis or the x-y diagonal also belongs
to the full set A ′ and has the same hopping amplitude
ta = tã.
For the usual nearest neighbor tight-binding model
(NN-model), already considered in [12], we have the set
ANN = {(1,0), (0,1)} with t(1,0) = t(0,1) = t = 1. The nu-
merical results presented in this work correspond either
to the NN-model (for illustration and comparison) or
to a longer-ranged tight-binding lattice according to [6]
which we denote as the HTC-model. For this case the
set of neighbor vectors is AHTC = {(1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (0,2),
(1,±2),(2,±1),(1,±1),(2,±2)} and the hopping amplitudes
are: t = t(1,0) = 1, t
′
= t(1,1) = −0.136, t
′′
= t(2,0) = 0.068,
t ′′′ = t(2,1) = 0.061 and t
(4)
= t(2,2) = −0.017 correspond-
ing to the values given in Table 2 of [6] (all energies are
measured in units of the hopping amplitude t = t(1,0) =
t(0,1) which is therefore set to unity here; see also Fig. 6a of
[6] for the neighbor vectors of the different hopping am-
plitudes). The hopping amplitudes for other vectors such
as (0,1), (1,−1), (2,1), (1,−2) etc. are obtained from the
above amplitudes by the appropriate symmetry transfor-
mations, e.g. t(1,−1) = t(1,1) = t
′
=−0.136 etc.
Even though that most of our numerical results pre-
sented in this work apply to the HTC-model (or the NN-
model), we emphasize that certain theoretical consid-
erations given below, especially for the effective block
Hamiltonian in relative coordinates at given total mo-
mentum, are valid for arbitrary generalized tight binding
models with more general sets A and also with a poten-
tial generalization to other dimensions.
The eigenstates of H1p given in (1) are simple plane
waves:

with energy eigenvalues:
E1p (p) =−2
∑

and momenta p = (px , py ) such that px and py are inte-
ger multiples of 2π/N (i.e. pα = 2πlα/N , lα = 0, . . . , N −1,
α= x, y). For the HTC model, we can give a more explicit
expression of the energy dispersion:
E1p (px , py ) =−2
[
cos(px)+cos(py )
]
−4t ′ cos(px )cos(py )−2t

which corresponds to eq. (30) of [6] (assuming t = 1 and
t (5) = t (6) = t (7) = 0).
The quantum Hamiltonian of the model with two in-
teracting particles (TIP) has the form:

is the one-particle Hamiltonian (1) of parti-
cle j = 1,2 with positional coordinate r j = (x j , y j ) and
1( j ) is the unit operator of particle j . The last term in (5)
represents a (regularized) Coulomb type long-range in-
teraction Ū (r2 − r1) = U /[1+ r (r2 − r1)] with amplitude
U and the effective distance r (r2 − r1) =

between the two electrons on the lattice with periodic
boundary conditions. (Here ∆x̄ = min(∆x, N −∆x); ∆ȳ =
min(∆y, N −∆y); ∆x = x2 − x1; ∆y = y2 − y1 and the lat-
ter differences are taken modulo N , i.e. ∆x = N + x2 − x1
if x2 − x1 < 0 and similarly for ∆y). Furthermore, we

consider symmetric (spatial) wavefunctions with respect
to particle exchange assuming an antisymmetric spin-
singlet state (similar results are obtained for antisymmet-
ric wavefunctions).
In absence of interaction (U = 0) the energy eigen-
values (the classical energy) of the two electron Hamilto-
nian (5) (the two electrons) at given momenta p1 and p2
are (is) given by:
Ec (p1,p2) = E1p (p1)+E1p (p2)
=−4
∑
a∈A
ta cos(p+ ·a/2)cos(∆p ·a)
(6)
where p+ = p1 + p2 is the total momentum and ∆p =
(p2−p1)/2 is the momentum associated to the relative co-
ordinate ∆r = r2 − r1. For the NN-model Eq. (6) becomes
Ec (p1,p2) =−4
∑
α=x,y cos(p+α/2)cos(∆pα).
Due to the translational invariance the total momen-
tum p+ is conserved even in the presence of interac-
tion (U 6= 0) and only two-particle plane wave states
with identical p+ are coupled by non-vanishing interac-
tion matrix elements. For the case of the NN-model, an-
alyzed in [12], the kinetic energy at fixed p+ is bounded
by ∆Eb = 4
∑
α=x,y |cos(p+α/2)|. Thus for TIP states with
E > ∆Eb the two electrons cannot separate and propa-
gate as one pair even if their interaction is repulsive. For
p+x = p+y = π+δ being close to π and |δ| ≪ 1 there are
compact Coulomb electron pairs even for very small in-
teractions U as soon as ∆Eb ≈ 4|δ| < U ≪ B2 with B2 =
16+U being the maximal energy bandwidth1 in 2D. Thus
the conservation of the total momentum of a pair with
p+x = p+y ≈ π leads to the appearance of an effective
narrow energy band with formation of coupled electron
pairs propagating through the whole system. However,
the results obtained in [12] show that even for other val-
ues of p+x , p+y the probability of pair formation is rather
high.
For the NN-model the effective band width for pairs
∆Eb can be exactly zero for the specific pair momentum
p+ = (π,π). However, this is not the case for the HTC-
model where due to the longer-ranged hopping the min-
imal width ∆Eb is finite due to the additional terms with
factors cos(p+ ·a/2) in (6). Therefore, we determined nu-
merically for each given value of total momentum p+ the
effective bandwidth as:
∆Eb (p+) = max

Ec (p1,p2)

width of the NN-model.
with p1 = p+/2−∆p and p2 = p+/2+∆p. Top panels of
Fig. 1 show density color plots of ∆Eb(p+) for the NN-
and the HTC-model. For the HTC-case ∆Eb(p+) is max-
imal at p+ = (0,0) with value ∆Eb,max = 17.952 and min-
imal at p+ = (π,π) with value ∆Eb,min = 2.176 while for
the NN-model we have ∆Eb,max = 16 at p+ = (0,0) and
∆Eb,min = 0 at p+ = (π,π). The value ∆Eb,min = 2.176 for
the HTC-model is still rather small compared to the max-
imal value ∆Eb,max ≈ 18 and we may expect a somewhat
stronger pair formation probability for total momenta p+
close to (π,π). However, this situation is qualitatively dif-
ferent as compared to the NN-model and the HTC-case
requires new careful studies.
For comparison, we also show in the lower panels of
Fig. 1 the kinetic energy Ec at p1 = p2 = p+/2 (for the
square p+ ∈ [0,π]× [0,π]) corresponding to ∆p = 0. While
for the NN-model this quantity vanishes at p+ = (π,π)
there is for the HTC-model a zero-line between the two
points (βπ,π) and (π,βπ) where β ≈ 0.877 ≈ 7/8 is a nu-
merical constant slightly below unity.
3 Full space time evolution of electron
pairs
As in [12] the full time evolution of two electrons is com-
puted numerically for N = 128 using the Trotter formula
approximation (see e.g. [12, 13] for computational de-
tails). We use the Trotter time step ∆t = B2 = 1/(16 +
U ) which is the inverse bandwidth for the case of NN-
model. A further decrease of the time step does not af-
fect the obtained results. At the initial time both elec-
trons are localized approximately at (N/2, N/2) with the
distance ∆x̄ = ∆ȳ = 1 using a linear combination of 8
states with all combinations due to particle exchange
symmetry and reflection symmetry at the ∆x- and ∆y-
axis. The method provides for each time value a wave-
function ψ(x1, y1, x2, y2) from which we extract different
quantities such as the density in x1-x2 plane:
ρX X (x1, x2) =
∑
y1,y2
|ψ(x1, y1, x2, y2)|

(8)
or the density ∆x-∆y plane:
ρrel(∆x,∆y) =
∑
x1 ,x2
|ψ(x1, y1, x1 +∆x, y1 +∆y)|

(9)
(with position sums taken modulo N ). We also compute
the quantity w10 by summing the latter density (9) over
all values such that |∆x̄| ≤ 10 and |∆ȳ | ≤ 10 which corre-
sponds to a square of size 21× 21 in ∆x-∆y plane (due
to negative values of x2 − x1 etc.). This quantity gives the

Figure 1 Top panels show the dependence of the effective
electron pair band width ∆Eb (p+) on the pair momentum
p+ = (p+x , p+y ). Bottom panels show the kinetic electron
pair energy Ec (p1,p2) (in absence of interaction) at momenta
p1 = p2 = p+/2. Left panels correspond to the NN-model
and right panels to the HTC-model. In all panels the horizon-
tal axis corresponds to p+x ∈ [0,π] and the vertical axis to
p+y ∈ [0,π]. The numbers of the color bar correspond for top

quantum probability to find both electrons at a distance
≤ 10 (in each direction) and we will refer to it as the pair
formation probability.
In Fig. 2 the density ρX X is shown for U = 2, both
NN- and HTC-models at two time values t = 445∆t and
t = 104∆t . These results show that the wavefunction has
a component with electrons separating from each other
and a component where electrons stay close to each
other forming a pair propagating through the whole sys-
tem that corresponds to a high density near a diagonal
with x1 ≈ x2. For t = 445∆t the value of w10 is roughly
10% and for t = 104∆t it is roughly 13% for both models.
However, the remaining diffusing component of about
87-90% probability has a stronger periodic structure for
the NN-model as compared to the HTC-model.
Figure 3 shows the density ρrel(∆x,∆y) for the same
cases of Fig. 2. We clearly see a strong enhancement of
the probability at small values ∆x̄ ≈ ∆ȳ < 5 (< 6 − 7)
for the NN-model (HTC-model) showing that there is a

more, the remaining wavefunction component of inde-
pendently propagating electrons, clearly visible in Fig. 2,
is not visible in the density shown in Fig. 3 even though
this component corresponds to 87-90% probability.

∼ 460 time values in the range ∆t ≤ t ≤ 104∆t with
roughly uniform logarithmic density) of the two densities

momentum
As already mentioned in Sec. 3 the total momentum p+
is conserved by the TIP dynamics of the Hamiltonian (5).
In order to exploit this more explicitly, we introduce as in

∆r are vectors on the square lattice (with position sums
in each spatial direction taken modulo N ). One can show
(see Appendix A for details) that the TIP Hamiltonian (5)
applied to such state gives a linear combination of such
states for different ∆r values but the same total momen-
tum value p+ which provides for each value or sector of
p+ an effective block Hamiltonian:

(p+)
a = 2cos(p+ ·a/2) ta is an effective rescaled hop-
ping amplitude depending also on p+ and we have for
simplicity omitted the index p+ in the block basis states.
This effective block Hamiltonian corresponds to a tight-
binding model in 2D of similar structure as (1) with mod-
ified hopping amplitudes and an additional “potential”
Ū (∆r). We note that in absence of this external poten-
tial (U = 0) the eigenfunctions of (11) are plane waves
and we immediately recover the expression (6) for its en-
ergy eigenvalues where ∆p is the momentum associated
to the relative coordinate ∆r. For the simple NN-model
the result for the effective block Hamiltonian was already
given in [12] and the above expression (11) provides the
generalization to arbitrary tight-binding lattices charac-
terized by a certain set of neighbor vectors A and as-
sociated hopping amplitudes ta (the generalization to
arbitrary spatial dimension is also obvious). As already
discussed in [12] the boundary conditions of (11) in x−
(y−)direction are either periodic if the integer index l+x
(l+y ) of p+x (p+y ) is even or anti-periodic if this index is
odd. This can be understood by the fact that the expres-
sion (10) is modified by the factor e±i p+x N /2 = e±iπl+x =
(−1)l+x if ∆x is replaced by ∆x ± N and similarly for ∆y
(with ∆r = (∆x,∆y)).
Diagonalizing the effective block Hamiltonian (11),
we can rather efficiently compute the exact quantum
time evolution |ψ̄(t )〉 = e−i h̄
(p+) t
|ψ̄(0)〉 inside a given sec-
tor of p+. As initial state |ψ̄(0)〉 we choose a state (in the
reduced block space) given as the totally symmetric su-
perposition of four localized states where ∆x and ∆y are
either 1 or N − 1. Such a state corresponds in full space
to a plane wave in the center of mass direction with total
fixed momentum p+ and strongly localized in the relative
coordinate ∆r. The matrix size of (11) is N 2 which corre-
sponds to a complexity of N 6 for the numerical diagonal-
ization.
However, for a general lattice, such as the HTC-model,
one can exploit the particle exchange symmetry to re-
duce the effective matrix size to roughly N 2/2 and for the
special cases of p+x = p+y or either p+x = 0 or p+y = 0
a second symmetry allows a further reduction of the ef-
fective matrix size to ≈ N 2/4 (for the NN-model there are
two or three symmetries for these cases with effective ma-
trix sizes of ≈ N 2/4 or ≈ N 2/8 respectively; see [12] and
Appendix A for details).
In view of this, we have been able to compute numer-
ically the exact time evolution for the HTC-model in cer-
tain p+ sectors for a lattice size up to N = 384 for the
case of two symmetries and a limited number of differ-
ent other parameters (values of p+ and U ). For the case
of one symmetry and the exploration of all possible val-
ues of p+x and p+y we used the maximum system size
N = 192. We also implemented more expensive compu-
tations where no or less possible symmetries are used to
verify (at smaller values of N ) that they provide identical
numerical results.

where ∆t = 1/B2 = 1/(16 +U ) is the time step already
used for the Trotter formula approximation given as the
inverse bandwidth for the case of the NN-model which is
the smallest time (inverse of the largest energy) scale of
the system.
From the wavefunction we extract in a similar way
as in Sec. 3 the pair formation probability w10 by sum-
ming the (normalized) wavefunction density |ψ̄(p+,∆r)|
2
at fixed p+ over the 21 × 21 square with |∆x̄| ≤ 10 and
|∆ȳ | ≤ 10. We also compute the inverse participation ra-
tio:
ξIPR =
(
∑
∆r
|ψ̄(p+,∆r)|

)−1
(12)
which gives roughly the number of lattice sites (in ∆r
space) over which the wavefunction is localized. Both
quantities w10 and ξIPR converge typically rather well to
their stationary values at times t > 103∆t with some time
dependent fluctuations. Therefore for the cases where
we are interested in the long time limit we compute the
wavefunction only for 70 times values (in the same inter-
val as above with uniform logarithmic density) and take
the average over the 21 values with 104 ≤ t /∆t ≤ 106. We
note that for the case of a uniform wavefunction density
the ergodic values are w10,erg = (21/N )
2 and ξIPR,erg = N
2.
Values of w10 significantly above w10,erg or of ξIPR below
ξIPR,erg indicate an enhanced probability for the forma-
tion of compact electron pairs.
We also mention that both quantities w10 and ξIPR
are invariant with respect to the three transformations
p+x ↔ p+y , p+x → −p+x and p+y → −p+y (or p+x →
2π− p+x and p+y → 2π− p+y ) corresponding to reflec-
tions at the x-y diagonal, the y-axis and the x-axis. Even
though the effective block Hamiltonian (11) is not (al-
ways) invariant with respect to all three of these transfor-
mations (see Appendix A for details), the choice of an in-
variant initial state ensures that at finite times the wave-
function in block space satisfies for example the identity
ψ̄(p+x , p+y ,∆x,∆y) = ψ̄(p+y , p+x ,∆y,∆x) (and similarly
for the other reflections). In other words a certain reflec-
tion transformation for p+ results in the equivalent trans-
formation for the time dependent block space wavefunc-
tion in ∆r space. Obviously the two quantities w10 and
ξIPR do not change with respect to these transformations
(in ∆r space) and therefore they are conserved. As a re-
sult it is sufficient to compute these quantities only for
the triangle 0 ≤ p+y ≤ p+x ≤π.
In the following sections we present the results for
these quantities and the wavefunction in block represen-
tation.

values U = 0.5 (top panels), U = 2 (bottom panels). Shown
is the pair formation probability w10 for N = 192 obtained
from the exact time evolution for each sector of p+ with an
initial electron distance ∆x̄ = ∆ȳ = 1 and computed from an
average over 21 time values in the interval 104 ≤ t /∆t ≤
106. In all panels the horizontal (vertical) axis corresponds to
p+x (p+y ) ∈ [0,π] and the numerical values of the color bar
correspond to the ratio of w10 over its maximal value. The
maximum values corresponding to the red region at the top
right corner p+ = (π,π) are w10 = 1 (both left panels), w10 =
0.4510 (top right) and w10 = 0.8542 (bottom right). For com-
parison the ergodic value is w10,erg. = (21/192)

= 0.01196.
5 Phase diagram of pair formation
The phase diagram of the long time average of the pair
formation probability w10 in the p+-plane is shown in
Fig. 4 for both models and the interaction values U =
0.5, 2. As expected from the features of the effective band-
width shown in (the top panels of) Fig. 1, we find that
globally for both models the pair formation probability is
clearly maximal at p+ = (π,π) and minimal at p+ = (0,0).
Furthermore, the size of the maximum region is signifi-
cantly stronger for U = 2 than for U = 0.5 which is also
to be expected. Thus for these p+ values even a rela-
tively weak or moderate Coulomb repulsion creates quite
strongly coupled electron pairs.
For the NN-model the top (p+y =π) or right (p+x =π)
boundary also provide large values with w10 ≈ 0.5 and
the width of these regions is stronger for U = 2 than for

U = 0.5. However, for U = 2 also the remaining region
provides values between 0.14 and 0.25 of the maximum
value which are clearly above the ergodic value 0.012.
Even for U = 0.5 the remaining region is mostly ≈ 0.04
(with some part close to 0.25) which is still above the er-
godic value.
For the HTC-model the situation is more compli-
cated. The boundary regions are more limited, espe-
cially for U = 0.5. However, for the remaining region
there is a new interesting feature which is a signifi-
cantly enhanced “green-circle” of approximate radius
rg =
√
p2+x +p
2
+y ≈ 0.85π for U = 0.5 (w10 ≈ 0.14). For
U = 2 there is also a circle (w10 ≈ 0.20) with approxi-
mate radius rg ≈ 0.75π. This circle seems to be less pro-
nounced despite its larger value of w10 as compared to
U = 0.5 due to the fact that the maximum value for U = 2
(w10 ≈ 0.85 at p+ = (π,π)) is roughly twice the maxi-
mum value for U = 0.5 (w10 ≈ 0.45). This structure can-
not be explained by the behavior of the effective band-
width. The minimum values of w10 at p+ ≈ (0,0) are
w10 ≈ 0.02− 0.03 (w10 ≈ 0.09− 0.10) for U = 0.5 (U = 2)
which are slightly (significantly) above the ergodic value
0.012.
Globally, nearly for all values of p+, for both mod-
els and both interaction values U = 0.5, 2 there is an en-
hanced probability to create coupled electron pairs.
The above observations are perfectly confirmed by
the phase diagram for the inverse participation ratio ξIPR
which is shown in Fig. 5 for the same cases and raw data
of Fig. 4. Large (small) values of ξIPR corresponds to small
(large) values of w10 and a small (strong) pair forma-
tion probability. Here minimum (maximum) values are
at p+ = (π,π) (p+ = (0,0)) as for the effective bandwidth
of Fig. 1 (see figure caption for the numerical minimum,
maximum and ergodic values). The boundary structure
of the NN-model and the circle-structure of the HTC-
case are also clearly visible.
We have also computed the long time average of the
pair formation probability for the HTC-model at larger
system size N = 256 and the special cases of either p+x =
p+y or p+y = 0 where the additional second symmetry
(see discussion in the previous section and Appendix A)
reduces the computational effort. In this way we can ex-
plore the diagonal and right boundary of the phase dia-
gram in more detail.
Figure 6 shows w10 for the HTC-model, N = 256, p+ =
p+x = p+y and both interaction values U = 0.5, 2 as a
function of the parameter ν = (1 − cos(p+/2))/2. Both
curves clearly confirm some of the observations of the
phase diagrams, i.e. strongest pair formation probability
at ν = 0.5 (p+x,y = π) with a somewhat larger maximum

all cases. The precise numerical maximum values of w10
at ν = 0.5 are slightly different from, but still in general
agreement with, those of Fig. 4 due to the different sys-
tem size. The corresponding figure for the NN-model was
already given in [12].

cal maximum at ν ≈ 0.5±0.1 (p+ ≈ π±π/8) correspond-
ing to green-circle with radius rg ≈ 0.85π visible in the
phase diagram. For U = 2 there are higher but less pro-
nounced local maxima at ν≈ 0.5±0.19 corresponding to
the slightly visible circle for this case. However, at U = 2
the value of w10 at ν = 0.5 is rather high while at U = 0.5
its value at ν = 0.5 is quite low but still clearly above the
ergodic limit.

ity w10 on ν = (1−cos(p+/2))/2 for p+ = p+x , p+y = 0 and
the HTC-model at U = 0.5,2 and N = 256. w10 is computed
from the same long time average as in Fig. 4. The value at
ν= 0.5 is w10 = 0.2302 (w10 = 0.01479) for U = 2 (U = 0.5).
Figures S1 and S2 of the supplementary material are
similar to Figs. 6 and 7 respectively but for the inverse
participation ratio ξIPR.
6 Time evolution of pair formation
We also computed a more precise time evolution of
the pair formation probability w10 for the larger system
size N = 384 and certain specific cases p+x = p+y ∈
{0, 2π/3, π} and p+y = 0 with p+x ∈ {7π/8, π}. The re-
sults together with the full space results using the Trot-
ter formula approximation at N = 128 are shown in Fig. 8
for U = 0.5, 2. In all cases the value of w10 starts decay-
ing from its initial value w10 = 1 at t /∆t > 20-30 and
converges to a long time saturation value for t /∆t > 103
sometimes with some temporal quasi-periodic fluctua-
tions. In most cases the saturation values at U = 2 are
clearly larger than for U = 0.5 except for the case p+y = 0
and p+x = 7π/8 where both saturation values are some-
what comparable. In particular, at U = 0.5 the value for
p+y = 0 and p+x = 7π/8 is significantly larger than the
value for p+y = 0 and p+x = π while at U = 2 it is the in-
verse. This observation is in agreement with the appear-
ance of the green circle in the phase diagram where for
U = 0.5 the circle is dominant in comparison to the right
boundary while for U = 2 it is dominated by the right
boundary.
The saturation value of the data obtained by the
Trotter formula approximation, which somehow corre-
sponds to an average over all possible p+ values, is quite
low if compared to the case p+ = 0 but still clearly above
the corresponding ergodic value (for its reduced system
size). Also for most of the other cases the saturation value
is clearly above the ergodic value except for U = 0.5,
p+y = 0 and p+x = π where the curve is a t ≈ 10
3
∆t even
below the ergodic value and saturates later at a value only
slightly above the ergodic value.
Motivated by the observation of the green-circle at
radius rg ≈ 0.85π in the phase diagram for U = 0.5, we
show in Fig. 9 the wavefunction amplitude at p+x =
7π/8, p+y = 0, N = 384 and both interaction values U =
0.5, 2 and two time values t /∆t = 100, 105. The first ob-
servation is that the diffusive spreading in x-direction
is strongly suppressed if compared to the y-direction
which is expected since p+x is rather close to π while
p+y = 0.
At U = 0.5 the steady-state at t /∆t = 105, despite
a smaller value of w10 = 0.0754 if compared to w10 =
0.1342 at U = 2, has a larger spatial extension of ∼ 30 lat-
tice sites compared to ∼ 12 lattice sites for U = 2. This in
rough qualitative agreement with the values ξIPR = 940
(for U = 0.5) and ξIPR = 268 (for U = 2). However, a large
amount of the contribution to the inverse participation
ratio comes from the remaining probability of about 87-
90% which has uniformly spread over the full lattice thus
explaining the difference between ξIPR and the visible

7 Results overview
The discussion of the phase diagram given in Fig. 4 has
shown that the pair formation probability is maximal at
the point p+ = (π,π). However, the surrounding region to
this point is quite small if compared to the green-circle
where we have a somewhat more modest pair formation
probability. In terms of available values of p+ the latter
region is possibly more important. In order to analyze
this point in a more quantitative way, we assume a simple

model where both electrons have the same momentum
p+/2 (i.e. ∆p = 0) and where the available states of this
type are filled from smallest to largest energies. We sub-
divide these states, ordered in energy, in slices of equal
number (∼ 1/100 of all available states) and compute the
average of w10 for each slice which is equivalent to the
average of w10 at lines of constant energy. In Fig.10, we
show the dependence of this average on the effective 2D-
filling factor ν2D which is the weight of slices below a cer-
tain energy.
For the NN-model we observe a strong peak at ν2D =
0.2 (and similarly at ν2D = 0.8 due to symmetry). This
peak is caused by the combination of the maximum
point at p+ = (π,π) and rather strong (top or right)
boundary contributions visible in the left panels of Fig. 4.
For the HTC-model at U = 2 this peak is still visible but
its value is reduced. However, for U = 0.5, there are two
separated peaks, a stronger one at ν2D ≈ 0.15 related to
the average over the green circle at radius rg ≈ 0.85 and a
second lower peak at ν2D ≈ 0.24 related to the average of
the maximum region close to p+ = (π,π). For this partic-
ular case, the green circle has a stronger global contribu-
tion to the pair formation probability than the maximum
region at p+ = (π,π).

ability w10 on the effective 2D filling factor ν2D for the NN-
lattice (top) and the HTC-lattice (bottom). The values of w10
have been obtained from the data of Fig. 4 (for N = 192) by
an average along lines of constant electron pair energy Ec
at momenta p1 = p2 = p+/2 with p+x , p+y ∈ [0,2π]. Low-
est (largest) energy corresponds to ν2D = 0 (ν2D = 1). The
data points shown correspond to an effective histogram with
bin width ∆ν2D ≈ 0.01. The red (blue) curve corresponds to
the interaction value U = 2 (U = 0.5) and the grey dashed line
corresponds to the ergodic value (21/192)2 = 0.01196.
8 Discussion
In our studies we analyzed the electron pair formation in
a tight-binding model of La-based cuprate superconduc-
tors induced by Coulomb repulsion. Our analytical and
numerical results show that even a repulsive Coulomb in-
teraction can form two electron pairs with a high prob-
ability. Such pairs have a compact size and propagate
through the whole system. We expect that such pairs may
contribute to the emergence of superconductivity in La-
based cuprates.
Of course, our analysis only considers two electrons
and in a real system at finite electron density there
is a Fermi sea which can modify electron interactions.
However, we expect that electrons significantly below
the Fermi energy will only create a mean-field potential
which will not significantly affect interacting electrons
with energies in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. A de-
tailed investigation of effects of finite electron density
on the Coulomb pair formation represents an important
task for future studies.

A Appendix
In this appendix we present the derivation of the block
Hamiltonian (11) and a more detailed discussion about
its discrete symmetries. In order to simplify the notations,
we will use here the full set A ′ = A ∪ (−A ) of neigh-
bor vectors (in the full and not only half plane) for the
summation over the vectors a which allows to reduce the
number of terms in the following expressions. The TIP
Hamiltonian (5) can then be written in a more explicit
form as:
H = −
∑
r1 ,r2
∑
a∈A ′
ta
(
|r1,r2〉〈r1 +a,r2|+ |r1,r2〉〈r1,r2 −a|
)
+
∑
r1 ,r2
Ū (r2 −r1)|r1,r2〉〈r1,r2| (13)
where for convenience we have written “r2 − a” instead
of “r2 + a” (in the second term of the first line) since for
a ∈ A ′ also −a ∈ A ′. Furthermore, the terms with shifts
of a in the left side have been absorbed by the increased
set A ′ (with respect to A used in (1)) combined with a
subsequent shift of the summation index r1 or r2 and ex-
ploiting the periodic boundary conditions.
Applying (13) to a block basis state (10) we find that:
H |p+,∆r〉 = −

(
|r1 −a,r1 +∆r〉e

)

Using the shift r1 → r1+a in the r1-sum of the first line
of this expression we obtain:

N
∑
r1
∑
a∈A ′

i p+·(r1+∆r/2)
)
(15)
+Ū (∆r)|p+,∆r〉
which can be rewritten as:
H |p+,∆r〉 = −

= −2
∑
a∈A ′
ta cos(p+ ·a/2) |p+,∆r+a〉 (17)
+Ū (∆r)|p+,∆r〉 .
The last expression provides exactly the effective block
Hamiltonian (11) if we replace the sum over a ∈ A ′ by
a sum over a ∈ A with two contributions “+a” and “−a”
and applying for the latter contribution a subsequent
shift ∆r →∆r+a in the ∆r sum. However, there is one ad-
ditional complication if∆r+a = (∆x +ax ,∆y +ay ) in (17)
leaves the initial square of ∆x,∆y ∈ {0, . . . N −1}. Then we
have to add (subtract) N to (from)∆x+ax and/or∆y+ay
which provides according to (10) the factor e±i p+x N /2 =
e±iπl+x = (−1)l+x (for ∆x and similarly for ∆y) resulting
in either periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions
in x- (y-)direction depending on the parity of the integer
index l+x (l+y ).
We close this appendix with a short discussion about
the discrete reflection symmetries of the block Hamilto-
nian (11) and the possibility to reduce its effective matrix
size N 2 due to such symmetries. For the NN-model, as
already discussed in detail in [12], there are at least two
symmetries with respect to∆x → N−∆x (reflection at the
∆y-axis) or∆y → N−∆y (reflection at the∆x-axis) and in
case if p+x = p+y there is a third symmetry with respect
to ∆x ↔ ∆y (reflection at the ∆x-∆y diagonal) which al-
lows for an effective matrix size of roughly either N 2/4 or
N 2/8 (if p+x = p+y ).
However, for a more general lattice, such as the HTC-
model, or more generally in presence of at least one
neighbor vector a = (ax , ay ) with both ax 6= 0 and ay 6=
0 (e.g. a = (1,1)) the number of symmetries is reduced.
For the most generic case with p+x 6= p+y , p+x 6= 0 and
p+y 6= 0 there is only one symmetry corresponding to par-
ticle exchange with two simultaneous transformations
∆x → N −∆x and ∆y → N −∆y which allows for a re-
duction of the effective matrix size to ≈ N 2/2. In this
case the factors cos(p+ ·a/2) = cos[(p+x ax+p+y ay )/2] ap-
pearing in the effective hopping amplitudes are not mod-
ified because the replacement a →−a due the symmetry
transformation only changes the global sign inside the
cosine argument. However, this is no longer true if we
apply for example the transformation ∆x → N −∆x with-
out modifying∆y which is equivalent to the replacement
of (ax , ay ) → (−ax , ay ) of the neighbor vectors. Therefore
a single reflection at the ∆y (or ∆x) axis modifies the
hopping amplitude (if both ax 6= 0, ay 6= 0 and also both
p+x 6= 0, p+y 6= 0) and (11) is (in general) not invariant
with respect to such transformations. However, if either
p+x = 0 or p+y = 0 the effective hopping amplitudes are
not modified with respect to these two individual reflec-
tions and we have two symmetries with an effective ma-
trix size of ≈ N 2/4. Also if p+x = p+y 6= 0 we have two sym-
metries (particle exchange and reflection at the∆x-∆y di-
agonal) leading also to an effective matrix size of ≈ N 2/4.
Finally, for the special case p+x = p+y = 0, we have even
three symmetries (as in the NN-Model for p+x = p+y )
with effective matrix size of ≈ N 2/8.

Supplementary Material for
Coulomb electron pairing in a tight-binding model of
La-based cuprate superconductors
by K. M. Frahm and D. L. Shepelyansky.
Here, we present additional material for the main part
of the article.
Figure S1 presents data for the inverse participation
ratio for the case of Fig. 6.
Figure S2 presents data for the inverse participation
ratio for the case of Fig. 7.
Two video files for the time evolution obtained by
the Trotter formula approximation corresponding to the
parameters of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are presented in files
videofig2.avi for the density ρX X (x1, x2) defined in
Eq. (8) and in videofig3.avi for the density ρrel(∆x,∆y)
defined in Eq. (9) (here N = 128, U = 2). Both video
files provide a direct comparison between the NN-model
(right box in video) and the HTC-model (left box in video)
and correspond to 464 time values t = l j ∆t (25 values
per second of video) with integer l0 = 0, 1 ≤ l j ≤ 10
4 for
j = 1, . . . ,463 and roughly uniform logarithmic density.

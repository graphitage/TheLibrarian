Abstract : In this article, we discuss an age-structured SIR model in which disease not only spread
through direct person to person contacts for e.g. infection due to surface contamination but it can also
spread through indirect contacts. It is evident that age also plays a crucial role in SARS virus infection
including COVID-19 infection. We formulate our model as an abstract semilinear Cauchy problem in an
appropriate Banach space to show the existence of solution and also show the existence of steady states.
It is assumed in this work that the population is in a demographic stationary state and show that there is
no disease-free equilibrium point as long as there is a transmission of infection due to the indirect contacts
in the environment.
Key Words :SIR Model, Age structured population model, Riesz-Fréchet-Kolmogorov theorem, Semi-

1 Introduction
Infectious diseases are one of threat to humanity. Due to increase in world population and mobility,
pathogen transmission is easy and it is difficult to control the spread of disease. Viral transmission depends
both on the interaction with host population and with the environment.
Mathematical models can project how infectious diseases progress. The model can suggest the possible
outcome of an epidemic which will help agencies to take well though measures. In 1927, Kermack and
McKendrick [3] introduced a model (called SIR model) by considering a given population having three
compartments. The compartments are divided into individuals in susceptible S; infected I;, and removed
R class. It is very important to study infectious diseases and their possible nature of spread.
Most of the cases it is assumed that the spread of infectious diseases is through person to person direct
contact. But some infectious diseases can also spread through indirect contacts like contact with contami-
nated surface having virus on it i.e. if a person touches their eyes, mouth or nose after touching fomites or
animals to human transmission. Through many studies it is observed that coronaviruses (including SARS
Cov2) may persist on objects or surfaces for some hours to many days. The persistence depends on different
factors (e.g. surface type, humidity or temperature of the environment). Fomites consist of both permeable

and non permeable objects or surfaces that can be contaminated with pathogenic micro-organisms and
serves as a vehicle in transmission. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is creating
the most severe health issues for individuals above the age of 60 — with particularly fatal results for those
individuals having age above 80. In the United states, 31-59% of individuals ages 75 to 84 diagnosed with
the virus having svere symptoms due to which hospitalization is necesaary, in comparing with 14-21%
of confirmed patients ages between 20 to 44. This data is based on US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) report. So, it is natural to consider age structure while modeling the infectious disease
transmission. The risk of transmission of infectious disease varies in different environments, for example
at school, at home, at work place or in the community. [4] studied projected age-specific contact rates for
countries in different stages in development and with different demographic structures to those studied in
POLYMOD (a European Commission project), which provide validated approximations to social contact
patterns when directly measured data is not available. The data plotted in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4
show the relation between age of individual and age of contact i.e. number of contacts made by individuals
at all locations, at home, school and work respectively. Yellowish color on the diagonal of Fig. 1 and Fig.
2 shows that same age individuals have more chances of direct contacts, so transmission coefficient will be
large for same age individuals.

From the above heat maps, it is clear that it is natural to add age structure in ordinary differential
equation(ODE) based SIR models. So, after adding age structure, the ODE based SIR models become
partial differential equation (PDE) models that are more complex to analyze. There is extensive litera-
ture available on age-structured SIR models (for more details see [1, 2, 5–11]). In [12] an epidemiological
model which study the impact of decline in population on the dynamics of infectious diseases especially
childhood diseases is considered and also an example of measles in Italy is considered and [13] studied the
SARS outbreak in Taiwan, using the data of daily reported cases from May 5 to June 4, 2003 to study
the spread of virus. H. Inaba [1] discussed threshold and stability results for an age structured SIR model,
Andrea [2] generalized the work of [1] and also considered immigration of infective in all epidemiological
compartments. We considered an age structured SIR model in which individuals can also get infected due
to contaminated surfaces. We also assume that the net reproduction rate of the host population is unity
which also makes our model different from the model considered in [2].
Our work is divided into four sections. In section 2, we formulate our age structured SIR model. In
section 3, we discuss the existence of solution to our model. In section 4, we discuss steady state solutions
and show that there is no disease free steady state solution as long as there is transmission due to indirect
contacts in the environment.
2 Model Formulation
Let U(a, t) be the density of individuals of age a at time t. µ(a) and β(a) be age dependent mortality and
fertility rates respectively. Let am be the maximum age which an individual can attain i.e. the maximum
life span of an individual. Then the evolution of U(a, t) can be modeled by the following McKendrick-Von
Foerster PDE with initial and boundary conditions:

∂U(a,t)
∂t
+
∂U(a,t)
∂a
= −µ(a)U(a, t) (a, t) ∈ (0, am)× (0,∞)
U(0, t) =
∫ am
0
β(a)U(a, t)da t ∈ (0,∞)
U(a, 0) = U0(a) a ∈ (0, am),
(2.1)
where U(0, t) denotes the number of newborns per unit time at time t. We suppose that the mortality rate
µ ∈ L1loc([0, am)) with the condition
∫ am
0
µ(a)da = +∞ and the fertility rate β ∈ L∞(0, am). e−
∫ a

µ(s)ds
indicates the proportion of individuals who are still living at age a and
∫ am

β(a)e−
∫ a

µ(s)dsda represents
the net reproduction rate. Let us assume that the net reproduction rate is 1. So, steady state solution is
given by U(a, t) = U(a) = β0e

µ(τ)dτ , where β0 is given by
β0 =
∫ am

∫ a

µ(τ)dτda
.
Let S(a, t), I(a, t) and R(a, t) be the densities of susceptible, infective and recovered individuals of age
a at time t. r(a, b) is the age dependent transmission coefficient which describes the contact process
between susceptible and infective individuals i.e. r(a, b)S(a, t)I(b, t)dadb is the number of individuals who
are susceptibles with age lies between a and a+ da and contract the disease after contact with an infective
individual aged between b and b + db. We assume the form of force of infection is given in the following

functional form
λ(a, t) =
∫ am
0
r(a, η)I(η, t)dη.
Then the disease spread according to the following system of partial differential equations

∂S(a,t)

∂S(a,t)

∂R(a,t)

S(0, t) =

0
β(a)(S(a, t) + I(a, t) +R(a, t))da, I(0, t) = 0, R(0, t) = 0
S(a, 0) = S0(a), I(a, 0) = I0(a) and R(a, 0) = R0(a).
(2.2)
b(a) is the recovery rate of individuals and c(a) is the proportion of individuals which are infected due
to surface contamination. This factor c(a) depends on the proportion of frontline workers as they are
susceptible to viral infection from indirect contacts even during lockdown situation (if lockdown is imposed).
Here we are assuming that spread of disease already started and fomites are present in the environment
even if transmission coefficient r(a, b) is zero. Assume that b, c ∈ L∞(0, am) and r ∈ L∞((0, am)× (0, am))
and also assume that all are non negative. [14] studied how respiratory and viral disease spread in the
presence of fomites. It is observed that enveloped respiratory viruses remain viable for less time and the
nonenveloped enteric viruses remain viable for longer time. They calculated the inactivations coefficients
of various respiratory viruses. Fig. 5 shows the respiratory virus inactivation rates (Kj). In Fig. 5, we
have used the short forms flu and cov for influenza and coronavirus respectively.
We impose the following conditions on our model:
i)Although there may be incubation period for some diseases but here we are assuming that there is
no incubation period and the individuals become infected instantaneously after contact with infected
individuals or fomites.
4
ii) We assume that the age zero individuals can not be infected.
iii) Transmission coefficient r(a, b) only summarizes the contact process between susceptible and infected
individuals.
iv) Population is in stationary demographic state.
v) The susceptible individuals who got infected due to contact with infected individuals have not infected
due to the contact with fomites and vice versa.
Let S(a, t), I(a, t) and R(a, t) be defined in the following way
S(a, t) =
S(a, t)
U(a, t)
, I(a, t) =
I(a, t)
U(a, t)
and R(a, t) =
R(a, t)
U(a, t)
and the force of infection is given by
λ(a, t) =
∫ am
0
r(a, η)U(η)I(η, t)dη.
Then our new system becomes

∂R(a,t)
∂t
+
∂R(a,t)
∂a
= b(a)I(a, t)
S(0, t) = 1, I(0, t) = 0, R(0, t) = 0
S(a, 0) = S0(a), I(a, 0) = I0(a) and R(a, 0) = R=(a)
S(a, t) + I(a, t) +R(a, t) = 1.
(2.3)
So, new transformations reduced our system into a simpler form i.e. boundary conditions now become
constant and there is no term involving natural mortality rate.
3 Existence of solution
If we observe system (2.3) carefully, then it is clear that once susceptible and infected individuals are
known, recovered individuals can be obtained easily so, it is enough to show the existence of solution to
the below SI system instead of full SIR system

∂S(a,t)

∂S(a,t)

∂t

∂I(a,t)
∂a
= λ(a, t)S(a, t) + c(a)S(a, t)− b(a)I(a, t)
S(0, t) = 1, I(0, t) = 0.
(3.1)
We will analyze the system (3.1) only, because force of infection does not explicitly depend on recovered
individuals. Let S̃(a, t) = S(a, t)− 1, Ĩ(a, t) = I(a, t), then the system (3.1) reduces to

∂S̃(a,t)
∂t

∂S̃(a,t)
∂a
= −λ(a, t)(1 + S̃(a, t))− c(a)(1 + S̃(a, t))
∂Ĩ(a,t)
∂t
+
∂Ĩ(a,t)
∂a
= λ(a, t)(1 + S̃(a, t)) + c(a)(1 + S̃(a, t))− b(a)Ĩ(a, t)
S̃(0, t) = 0, Ĩ(0, t) = 0.
λ(a, t) =
∫ am
0
r(a, η)U(η)Ĩ(η, t)dη.

Let X = L1(0, am;C2) equipped with the L1 norm and linear operator A be defined as
(Aξ)(a) = (−
d
da
ξ1(a)− c(a)ξ1(a),−
d
da
ξ2(a)− b(a)ξ2(a)− c(a)ξ1(a))
where ξ = (ξ1(a), ξ2(a)) ∈ D(A)
D(A) = {ξ = (ξ1, ξ2) ∈ X | ξ1, ξ2 ∈ AC[0, am], ξ(0) = (0, 0)}
AC[0, am] is the set of absolutely continuous functions.
Suppose that r(a, b) ∈ L∞((0, am)× (0, am)) and
(Fξ)(a) = (−(Pξ2)(a)(1 + ξ1(a))− c(a), (Pξ2)(a)(1 + ξ1(a)) + c(a)), ξ ∈ X,
where bounded linear operator P is defined by
(Pψ)(a) =
∫ am
0
r(a, η)U(η)ψ(η)dη, ψ ∈ L1(0, am).
Now, system (3.2) can be written as an abstract semilinear Cauchy problem in Banach space X
d
dt
Z(t) = A(t)Z(t) + F (Z(t)), Z(0) = Z0 ∈ Z
where Z(t) = (S̃(·, t), Ĩ(·, t)) ∈ Z, Z0(a) = (S̃0(a), Ĩ0(a))
In the same manner as proved in [1], we can prove that A generates a C0 semigroup S(t), t ≥ 0 and F is
continuously Fréchet differentiable on X.
So, for each Z0 ∈ X, there exists a maximal interval of existence [0, t0) and a unique solution t −→ Z(t;Z0)
which is continuous from [0, t0) to X such that
Z(t, Z0) = S(t)Z0 +
∫ t
0
S(t− σ)F (Z(σ;Z0))dσ ∀ t ∈ [0, t0].
Moreover, if Z0 ∈ D(A), then Z(t;Z0) ∈ D(A) for 0 ≤ t < t0 and t −→ Z(t;Z0) is continuously differen-
tiable and satisfies (3.2) on [0, t0).

The force of infection depends on number of infected individuals and number of infected individuals also
depend on the proportion of individuals getting infected due to indirect contacts (steady state solution
shows this). So, force of infection will automatically take care of fomites present in the environment.
The force of infection is given by

Using (4.2), we can get the following estimate
|λ(a)|≤ U‖r‖∞‖I‖1
where ‖‖∞ and ‖‖1 are the L∞ and L1 norms respectively and U is the total population.
Therefore, λ ∈ L∞(0, am).
It is clear that there is no disease free equilibrium as long as there is transmission due to fomites in the
environment. That means if there are fomites present in the environment contaminated with pathogenic
micro-organisms, disease still can spread without direct contact between susceptible and infected individ-
uals.
On Banach space E = L1(0, am), with positive cone E+ = {ψ ∈ E | ψ ≥ 0 a.e.}, let us define
Φ(ψ)(a) =

φ(a, σ)(ψ(σ) + c(σ)) exp

Suppose that we have the following assumptions
(A1) r(·, ·) satisfies limh−→0
∫ am
0
‖r(a + h, s) − r(a, s)‖da = 0 uniformly for s ∈ R with r(·, ·) extended by
defining r(a, s) = 0 for a.e. a, s ∈ (−∞, 0) ∪ (am,∞).
(A2) There exist m > 0, 0 < α < am such that r(a, b) ≥ m for a.e. (a, b) ∈ (0, am)× (am − α, am).
(A3) There exist a1, a2 satisfying 0 ≤ a1 < a2 ≤ am such that c(a) > 0 a.e. a ∈ (a1, a2).
Observe that
Φ(0)(a) =
∫ am
0
φ(a, σ) exp
(
−
∫ σ

c(η)dη
)
c(σ)dσ. (4.6)
Since force of infection is non negative, we have
λ(a) ≥ Φ(0)(a) a.e. a ∈ (0, am)
and because of assumption (A2), we have Φ(0)(a) > 0. Now, we will prove an important theorem which
will help us to show the existence of fixed point to (4.5).

Theorem 4.1. Let D = {ψ ∈ L1+(0, am) | ‖ψ‖1≤ M, M is a positive constant} and suppose that the as-
sumptions (A1)-(A3) hold, then
(a) D is bounded, closed, convex and also Φ(D) ⊆ D.
(b) Φ is completely continuous .
Hence, Schauder’s principle gives existence of fixed point of (4.5).
Proof. Boundedness of set D is clear and also for any ψ1, ψ2 ∈ D, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 we have
pψ1 + (1− p)ψ2 ∈ D.
Closedness also follows from the definition of D. Now, we will show that Φ(D) ⊆ D.

Now we will prove that Φ is compact operator, so let us define T1, T2 : L

+(0, am) −→ L1+(0, am) by
T1(ψ)(a) =

ψ(σ)k1(a, σ)dσ (4.8)

)
. (4.10)
The operators T1, T2 are linear, continuous and positive. By applying Riesz-Fréchet-Kolmogorov theo-
rem on compactness in L1, we can conclude that T1, T2 are compact operators. Now, let us define nonlinear
operators F1, F2 : L
1
+(0, am) −→ L1+(0, am) by
F1(ψ)(σ) = ψ(σ) exp

(4.11)
F2(ψ)(σ) = exp
(

)
. (4.12)
Here, F1, F2 are continuous and hence T ◦ F1, T ◦ F2 are compact operators in L1+(0, am).
Therefore, Φ = T ◦ F1 + T ◦ F2 is compact operator. Hence, Schauder’s principle gives existence of fixed
point of (4.5).
Let T = Φ
′
(0) denote the Fréchet derivative of Φ at 0 i.e.
T (ψ)(a) =

dσ for a ∈ (0, am), ψ ∈ L1(0, am).
Clearly, T is a positive linear, continuous and also compact operator. Let us define
T0(ψ)(a) =
∫ am
0
φ(a, σ)ψ(σ)dσ (4.13)
Tn(ψ)(a) =
∫ am

φ(a, σ)ψ(σ) exp
(

cn(η)dη
)
dσ (4.14)
where cn is the sequence of the proportion of individuals infected due to indirect contacts. The spectral
radius (ρ(T )) of the operator T plays an important role in deciding the nature of equilibrium solutions i.e.
whether disease free equilibrium solution exists or not. In our case if there is a proportion of individuals
who are infected due to fomites, disease free equilibrium point will not exists. Our aim is to prove the
following theorem:
Theorem 4.2. Let T0 be as defined in (4.13) and Φn be analogous to Φ in which c is replaced by cn.
9
(a) If spectral radius ρ(T0) ≤ 1, then the sequence {ψn} of fixed points of Φn converges to zero.
(b) If spectral radius of T0 is larger than 1, then ∃γ > 0 such that ‖ψn‖≥ γ ∀n ∈ N.
Our aim is also to prove that
lim
n→∞
ρ(Tn) = ρ(T0)
which gives dependence of force of infection on cn. Before proving the above theorem, we will prove some
lemmas and also state some theorems.
Definition 4.3. Let E+ ⊂ E be a cone in Banach space E, then the cone E+ is called total if the following
set
{f − g : f, g ∈ E+}
is dense in Banach space E.
Theorem 4.4. (Krein-Rutman (1948)) Let E be a real Banach space and E+ be total order cone in E.
Let A : E −→ E be positive linear and compact operator w.r.t. E+ and also ρ(A) > 0. Then ρ(A) is an
eigen value of A and A∗ with eigen vectors in E+ and E∗+ respectively.
In SIR model without fomites transmission coefficient c, Inaba [1] proved the following results:
Theorem 4.5. ( [1] Proposition 4.6) Let T be the Fréchet derivative of Φ at 0
(a) If spectral radius ρ(T ) ≤ 1, then there is a disease free fixed point ψ = 0 to the operator Φ.
(b) If spectral radius ρ(T ) > 1, then there exist atleast one non zero fixed point of Φ.
Theorem 4.6. ( [15] Theorem V6.6) Let E = Lp(µ), p ∈ [1,∞] and (Z,S, µ) be a σ− finite measure
space. Suppose A ∈ L(E) is defined by
Ag(t) =
∫
K(s, t)g(s)dµ(s), g ∈ Lp(µ),
non negative K is S × S measurable kernel which satisfy the following assumptions
(a) Some power of A is compact.
(b) C ∈ S and µ(C) > 0, µ(Z \ C) > 0
=⇒
∫
Z\C
∫
C
K(s, t)dµ(s)dµ(t) > 0.
Then ρ(A) > 0 is an eigen value of A with a unique normalized eigen function g satisfying g(C) > 0 µ-a.e.
; moreover if K(s, t) > 0 µ⊗ µ-a.e, then every other eigen value λ of A has the bound |λ|< ρ(A).
Let {cn} be a sequence in L∞+ (0, am) such that cn(a) −→ 0 as n −→∞ a.e. a ∈ (0, am) i.e. proportion
of individuals who are susceptible to fomite infection are becoming less and Φ0 is defined as in (4.5) with
c = 0.
Propostion 4.7. There exist a converging subsequence {ψnk} of {ψn} such that if ψ = limk→∞ ψnk , then
ψ is the fixed point of Φ0.

Proof. Because Φ0 is compact and 0 ≤ ‖ψn‖≤M, ∃ a converging subsequence {Φ0(ψnk)} and let
ψ = lim
k→∞
Φ0(ψnk).
Because
Φnk(ψnk)− Φ0(ψnk) =

∵ lim

cn(a) = 0 a.e. a ∈ (0, am)
we have lim
k→∞
[Φnk(ψnk)− Φ0(ψnk)] = 0.
∴ lim
k→∞
ψnk = lim
k→∞
Φnk(ψnk)
= lim
k→∞
[Φ0(ψnk) + Φnk(ψnk)− Φ0(ψnk)] = ψ.
Because Φ0 is continuous, we have
lim
k→∞
Φ0(ψnk) = Φ0(ψ) = ψ
which proves that
Φ0(ψ) = ψ.
Lemma 4.8. Suppose T0 be as defined in (4.13), then ρ(T0) is an eigen value of both T0 and T
∗
0 with
unique strictly positive normalized eigen vectors ψ and f respectively.
Proof. We know that
T0(ψ)(a) =
∫ am
0
φ(a, η)ψ(η)dη
and is a compact operator by Theorem 4.1. Comparing T0 with A, conditions of Theorem 4.6 are satisfied
and therefore ρ(T0) > 0 is the only eigen value of T0 with a unique normalized eigen vector ψ ∈ L1+(0, am),
satisfying ψ(a) > 0 a.e. and every other eigen value λ of T0 satisfy |λ|< ρ(T0). Also T0 and T ∗0 both have
same non zero eigen values with same multiplicities. Since ρ(T0) is the only eigen value of T0 with a unique
normalized eigen vector ψ, ρ(T0) is also an algebraically simple eigen value of T
∗
0 with unique normalized
eigen function f . Now our task is to prove that eigen function f is strictly positive. Suppose function
f̂ ∈ L∞+ \ {0} representing the functional f be defined as
〈f, ψ〉 =
∫ am
0
f̂(η)ψ(η)dη ∀ψ ∈ L1(0, am).
Now, T ∗0 (ϕ)(a) =
∫ am
0
ϕ(η)φ(η, a)dη ∀ϕ ∈ L∞(0, am),
11
there exist a function g : [0, am] −→ R which is continuous and g(a) > 0 ∀a ∈ [0, am) and vanishes at am
(because of assumption (A2)) such that φ(η, a) ≥ g(a) a.e. η, a ∈ (0, am).
Then, f̂(a) =
1
ρ(T0)
T ∗0 (f̂)(a) ≥
1
ρ(T0)
g(a)
∫ am
0
f̂(η)dη > 0
So, f is strictly positive as f̂ ∈ L∞+ (0, am) \ {0}.
Lemma 4.9. Let T0 and Tn be as defined in (4.13) and (4.14) respectively. Then
lim
n→∞
ρ(Tn) = ρ(T0) and ρ(Tn) ≥ ρ(T0) ∀n.
Proof. Clearly Tn −→ T0 uniformly. Since T0 and Tn are compact operators and ρ(T0) and ρ(Tn) are
simple eigen values of T0 and Tn respectively, we have the conclusion of our lemma.
Now, we are ready to prove our Theorem 4.2
Proof. We know that any converging subsequence {ψnk} of {ψn} converges to ψ, the fixed point of Φ0. By
Theorem 4.5, for ρ(T0) ≤ 1,Φ0 has only one fixed point which is 0. So, every convergent subsequence of
{ψn} converges to zero, i.e. the sequence {ψn} converges to zero. Now, we will prove the part (b) of the
theorem.
Given ρ(T0) > 1, by lemma 4.9 we have ρ(Tn) > 1 ∀n.
Let fn ∈ (L1+(0, am))∗ \ {0} be the strictly positive eigen vector of T ∗n with eigen value ρ(Tn). Then for all
n, we have
〈fn, ψn〉 = 〈fn,Φnψn〉 = 〈fn, Φ̄nψn + un〉
where Φ̄n = Φn − un and un is defined by integral on R.H.S. of (4.6) with c replaced by cn.
Observe that
exp(−‖ψ‖1)T0ψ ≤ Φ̄ψ ≤ T0ψ ∀ψ ∈ L1+(0, am)
Therefore,
〈fn, ψn〉 ≥ 〈fn, exp(−‖ψn‖1)Tnψn + un〉 > 〈fn, exp(−‖ψn‖1)Tnψn〉
= exp(−‖ψn‖1)〈T ∗nfn, ψn〉 = exp(−‖ψn‖1)ρ(Tn)〈fn, ψn〉
Therefore,
exp(−‖ψn‖1)ρ(Tn) < 1 ∀n
i.e. ‖ψn‖1> log(ρ(Tn)) ≥ log(ρ(T0))
choose γ = log(ρ(T0)) > 0
then the conclusion of our theorem holds.

5 Discussion
The figures on data related to interaction show that the age plays a crucial role in SARS diseases and
especially in COVID-19 infection as well as in recovery. So, we have studied an age structured SIR model
in which susceptible individuals not only get infected due to direct contact with infected person, but can
also get infected due to contact with contaminated surfaces. We proved that there is no disease free
equilibrium as long as there is transmission due to indirect contacts in the environment. That means for
instance if there are fomites present in the environment contaminated with pathogenic micro-organisms,
disease still can spread without direct contact between susceptible and infected individuals. So, removing
fomites present on the surfaces is one of the effective measure to slow the infection. Hence sanitization of
surfaces and proper care to frontline workers will help to fight with such diseases.

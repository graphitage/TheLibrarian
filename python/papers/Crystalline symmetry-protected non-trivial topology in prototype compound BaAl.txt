The BaAl4 prototype crystal structure is the most populous of all structure types, and is the
building block for a diverse set of sub-structures including the famous ThCr2Si2 family that hosts
high-temperature superconductivity and numerous magnetic and strongly correlated electron sys-
tems. The MA4 family of materials (M=Sr, Ba, Eu; A=Al, Ga, In) themselves present an intriguing
set of ground states including charge and spin orders, but have largely been considered as uninter-
esting metals. Using electronic structure calculations, symmetry analysis and topological quantum
chemistry techniques, we predict the exemplary compound BaAl4 to harbor a three-dimensional
Dirac spectrum with non-trivial topology and possible nodal lines crossing the Brillouin zone,
wherein one pair of semi-Dirac points with linear dispersion along the kz direction and quadratic
dispersion along the kx/ky direction resides on the rotational axis with C4v point group symme-
try. Electrical transport measurements reveal the presence of an extremely large, unsaturating
positive magnetoresistance in BaAl4 despite an uncompensated band structure, and quantum oscil-
lations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements confirm the predicted multi-
band semimetal structure with pockets of Dirac holes and a Van Hove singularity (VHS) remarkably
consistent with the theoretical prediction. We thus present BaAl4 as a new topological semimetal,
casting its prototype status into a new role as building block for a vast array of new topological
materials.
The development of a better understanding of the role
of topology in electronic states has led to a revolution
in exploring both old and new compounds for non-trivial
topologies, and has provided a fertile platform to search
for new topological fermionic excitations [1–3]. The dis-
covery of topological insulators (TIs) with robust metallic
surface states protected by the topology of the insulat-
ing bulk [1, 2] was followed by the discovery of topolog-
ical semimetals (TSMs). These are found to have deep
connections with particle physics models of relativistic
chiral (Weyl) fermions and also provide fermionic excita-
tions without high-energy counterparts [3–12]. In a Dirac
semimetal (DSM), bulk valence and conduction bands
cross each other linearly at discrete points protected by
time-reversal, inversion and crystal symmetries. These
stable Dirac points with four-fold degeneracy make it
possible to simulate massless Dirac fermions [3, 4]. By
breaking either inversion or time reversal symmetry, a
Dirac semimetal can be tuned to a Weyl state where the
nondegenerate linear touchings of the bulk bands come
in pairs. Each Weyl point with two-fold-degeneracy has a
definite chirality of ±1 and the quasiparticle excitations
mimic the relativistic Weyl (chiral) fermions [5, 6, 13, 14].
Cd3As2 and Na3Bi were the first theoretically pre-
dicted DSM candidates [15, 16], subsequently con-
firmed by experiments [17–20]. Recently, several materi-
als including transition-metal icosagenides MA3 (M=V,
Nb, and Ta; A=Al, Ga, In) [21], MgTa2N3 [22, 23],
CaAgBi [24] and PtTe2 [25], were predicted to host Dirac
fermions. These form part of an even larger list of TSMs
[26–28] that also exhibit exotic physical properties in-
cluding high carrier mobilities, chiral anomaly physics
and topological superconductivity. Extremely large mag-
netoresistance (MR) is another symptom of such materi-
als, which is usually very small in non-magnetic, non-
compensated metals according to semiclassical trans-
port theory. However, several TSMs – including Dirac
semimetals Cd3As2 and ZrSiS [29–31], the NbAs fam-
ily [32–35], the type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2 [36] and
several other TSMs such as NbSb2 [37], PtSn4 [38, 39],
LaSb[40] – exhibit extremely large MR behavior which
could have potential application in magnetic sensors,
spintronics and memories. Very recently, multiple topo-
logical states have been predicted and observed in the
iron-based superconductors LiFeAs and Fe(Se,Te)[41],
while possible Dirac fermions are predicted in heavy

fermion superconductors Ce(Co,Rh,Ir)In5[42].
The MA4 family of materials (M=Sr, Ba, Eu;
A=Al,Ga,In) form the prototype parent crystal structure
of a large family of compounds including the ThCr2Si2-
based iron superconductors[43], classic heavy fermions
systems such as CeCu2Si2[44, 45], and numerous non-
centrosymmetric compounds[46]. In addition, the MA4
family itself presents a rich variety of ground states. For
instance, SrAl4 exhibits a charge density wave transition
at 200 K, while Eu(Ga,Al)4 orders antiferromagnetically
at 15 K and is thought to also exhibit charge density wave
order [47, 48]. In this work, we present the first compre-
hensive combined experimental and theoretical study of
topology in the classic prototype compound BaAl4, in-
cluding first principles electronic structure calculations,
transport measurements, and angle-resolved photoemis-
sion (ARPES) studies. We predict BaAl4 to be a topolog-
ical three dimensional Dirac semimetal, where one pair
of type-I Dirac points resides on the rotational axis with
the C4v point group symmetry, and confirm this predic-
tion using ARPES and quantum oscillations experiments.
The calculated band structure is in excellent agreement
with ARPES spectra, and Hall resistivity and quantum
oscillations measurements confirm the multi-band struc-
ture with electron and hole pockets, and is consistent
with the predicted presence of Dirac hole pockets. To-
gether with an extremely large MR that does not saturate
in fields up to 32 T, our results indicate BaAl4 is a new
topological semimetal, and point to the MA4 family of
materials as fertile territory for the exploration of a new
basis of topological systems.
Non-Trivial Topology in BaAl4
Fig. 1(a,b) presents schematic illustrations of both the
crystal structure and the bulk Brillouin zone of BaAl4.
The high quality of single crystals grown by a self-flux
method (see Fig. 1(c)) is confirmed by X-ray diffraction
(FIG. S1 in SM) and core-level electron photoemission
spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1(d). Rietveld refinement of
powder X-ray diffraction spectra confirms our samples to
have the body-centered tetragonal structure with space
group I4/mmm (No. 139). Clear peaks from Ba-5s, Ba-
5s, and Al-2p core-level electrons observed by photoemis-
sion spectroscopy confirm the correct chemical composi-
tion.
In the BaAl4 unit cell, the Ba atoms sit at the Wyckoff
position 2a, while the Al atoms sit at two non-equivalent
Wyckoff positions 4d and 4e, as shown in Table I in the
Supplementary Materials. Among them, 2a and 4d sites
are the maximal Wyckoff positions, but 4e is not. The
4e Wyckoff position has a stabilizer group [49] which is a
subgroup of the stabilizer group of the maximal positon
2a or 2b. Fig. 1(e,f) show the calculated bulk electronic
structure along high-symmetry lines without (with) spin-
orbit coupling, showing its semimetallic ground state fea-
ture. One observes that there are several crossing points
along Γ−X, Γ−Σ, and Z−Σ1 directions in different mir-
ror reflection planes from two quasi-linear bands close to
the Fermi level (EF ) in the band structure without SOC.
These Dirac nodal points could give rise to a variety of
nodal Dirac nodal lines in each mirror plane and also
exotic surface states, which deserve further study.
Once the SOC is included, most of these crossing
points open small gaps because the two crossing bands
belong to same irreducible representation of the point
group indicated by the eigenvalue analyses. For example,
the two bands crossing each other along Γ− Σ direction
at ∼ 0.1 eV both belong to Γ5 representation and then
the crossing point is gapped out. However, the crossing
point along Γ − Z direction is different. On Γ − Z
path which is along the rotational axis, the point group
symmetry is of C4v. The two doubly-degenerate crossing
bands (highlighted by the red square in Fig. 1(f)) are
found to form two distinct irreducible representations
Γ6 and Γ7 representation of the C4v double group. In
Fig. 1(g), we show these two bands belong to different
representations of the symmetry group; therefore, the
intersection of the two double-degenerate bands is
protected by the crystalline symmetry, C4v, forming a
massless Dirac fermion. Figs. 1(h,i) show the zoomed
dispersion along out-of-plane (kz) and in-plane directions
(kx/ky). While the slopes of the two crossing bands
along the out-of-plane (kz) have opposite signs, remi-
niscent of a type-I Dirac point [16–20], the dispersion
along the other directions show quadratic dispersion.
The crossing points are above the Fermi level, according
to the ab initio calculations. The physical elemental
band representations (pEBRs) are constructed by the
orbitals at the maximal positions with time reversal
symmetry [49], with all the pEBRs of 2a 2b and 4d
listed in Table II in the Supplementary Materials. For
high-symmetry points, the eigenvalues (irreps) of all
symmetry operators have been computed [50] from the
VASP wave functions for each band [27, 51]. Referring
to the character tables in the Bilbao Crystallographic
Server (BCS) [49, 52], we successfully assign all the
bands to corresponding irreducible representations
(irreps). The irrep characters of the valence bands are
listed in Table III in the Supplementary Materials. One
can check if those valence bands can be decomposed
into a linear combination of pEBRs. It turns out they
can not, which means those valence bands cannot be
topologically trivial.

ARPES to obtain the electronic structure of BaAl4 at

FIG. 1. Non-trivial topology of prototype compound BaAl4. The crystal structure (a) and Brillouin zone (b) of single-
crystalline BaAl4 (c) with I4/mmm space group are presented along with electronic structure calculations and symmetry
analysis, revealing a three-dimensional Dirac spectrum with non-trivial topology. (d) The integrated photoemission core-level
spectrum exhibits sharp peaks from Ba-5s, Ba-5p, and Al-2p core-levels, confirming high sample quality. The calculated
bulk electronic structure is presented (e) without spin-orbit coupling and (f) with spin-orbit coupling included, with red
box highlighting the Γ–Z dispersion where a Dirac point is located. (g) Enlarged low-energy band structure with irreducible
representation, where the two crossing bands belong to two different irreducible representations of the C4v point group, showing
the accidental band crossing protected by the crystal symmetry. The zoomed 3D Dirac structure exhibits a linear dispersion
along the out-of plane (kz) direction [panel (h)] and a quadratic dispersion along the in-plane (kx/ky) directions [panel (i)],
classifying this as a semi-Dirac point where massless and massive fermions can coexist at the same point in momentum space
(see text).
various photon energies, using in-situ cleaved single crys-
tals of BaAl4 where the (001) surface cleavage plane
is determined by X-ray diffraction (FIG. S1(b) of Sup-
plementary Information). Fig. 2 shows the measured
ARPES spectra compared to calculation (red curves).
The intensity variation across the measured ARPES data
is attributed to photoemission matrix element effects.
Note that we shifted the calculated band structure by 70
meV (hole doping) to take into account the experimen-
tal data in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a), we present the Fermi
surface in the out-of-plane direction. The highly dis-
persive Fermi surface is clearly resolved, suggesting its
bulk three-dimensional nature. Fig. 2(e) shows the en-
ergy and momentum cut along the Z − Γ−Z line where
the C4v exists. Consistent with the DFT prediction, the
tail of the Dirac dispersion, which consists of small and
large electron pockets at Z and Γ points respectively,
is observed. To further investigate the electronic struc-
tures, we show the in-plane Fermi surfaces for the high-
symmetry planes (kz ∼ 0, kz ∼ 2π/c, and kz ∼ 0.92π/c
where the Dirac point (DP) protected by C4v is located)
and the electronic dispersions (Γ−Σ, Z−Σ1, and DP) in
Fig. 2(b–c) and Fig. 2(f–h). Overall, the experimental
Fermi surfaces and electronic dispersions are consistent
with band structure calculations for all directions.
Similar to graphene, multiple Dirac dispersions in
BaAl4 create a saddle-point singularity in between the
two DPs in momentum space as a result of a change in

electronic topology, reminiscent of a Lifshitz transition
in the electronic structure. Fig. 3(a) shows the location
of the DP and VHS in the bulk BZ of BaAl4. To iden-
tify the saddle-point singularity experimentally, we show
the energy and momentum dispersion along Z − Γ − Σ
direction (along the red line in the Fig. 3(a,b)) in Fig.
3(c). While the tail of the Dirac dispersion has the lo-
cal energy minimum in between the DPs, the Γ point,
the dispersion along the orthogonal direction (in-plane
direction, Γ − Σ) has the opposite curvature, resulting
in the saddle point singularity of band structure, a Van
Hove singularity (VHS). The integrated energy distribu-
tion curve (EDC) around the Γ point shown in Fig. 3(d)
clearly indicates the peak of local density of states (DOS)
at ∼ −0.45 eV. This peak is consistent with a local DOS
maximum in a saddle-point since the band structure is
nearly flat at the VHS. Emergence of a VHS is associated
with a Lifshitz transition. Fig. 3(e–j) represent a series of
ARPES constant energy maps near the Γ point (see the
blue square in Fig. 3(b)) with various binding energies,
emphasizing the change of topology of electronic struc-
tures. The energy contours of Dirac dispersions become
close to each other toward the Γ point as the binding en-
ergy changes to deeper level (shown in Fig. 3(e–g)). Once

red lines superposed in these panels here are the DFT calculation results for EB = −0.27, −0.4, −0.45, −0.497, −0.55, and
−0.57, respectively. For a direct comparison, all constant energy maps (a,e–j) and the energy and momentum cut (c) shown

it reaches the Lifshitz point (∼ −0.45 eV), the two uncon-
nected tails of Dirac dispersions merge and the electronic
topology changes as shown in Fig. 3(h–j). This change
in electronic topology is also clearly reproduced by the
theoretical calculation (The red lines in Fig. 3(h–j)).
Because the Dirac point protected by C4v symmetry is
above EF and hence not accessible to ARPES, we can-
not directly observe the vicinity of DP. However, the ex-
cellent agreement between our ARPES results and the
first-principles calculation, validates the theoretical pre-
diction of Dirac fermions above EF , confirming BaAl4 as
a topological semimetal with Dirac points. The observa-
tion of the saddle point singularity VHS and the Lifshitz
point in between DPs identifies this family of materials
as an ideal 3D analogue of graphene, similar to Na3Bi.
Moreover, in BaAl4, while the Dirac dispersion along the
out-of-plane axis (kz) has a linearly type-I dispersion, the
dispersion is quadratic along the in-plane axis (kx/ky)
as shown in Fig. 1(h,i) and Fig. 2(e,h). Hence these
DPs can be classified as semi-Dirac points where mass-
less and massive fermions can coexist at the same point
in momentum space. Similar semi-Dirac points are the-
oretically predicted and/or experimentally observed in
two-dimensional systems such as a silicene oxide Si2O
and black phosphorus [53, 54], and could result in inter-
esting properties including highly anisotropic transport,
distinct Landau level spectrum in a magnetic field, non-
Fermi liquid, and Bloch-Zener oscillations.[55, 56]

bilities approaching 200,000 cm2/Vs (see Hall analysis

(RRR=ρ(300K)/ρ(2K)=1,500 in Sample A) and tiny
residual resistivities (∼ 90 nΩ·cm). As observed in other
TSMs such as WTe2, NaBi3, Cd3As2, TaAs, LaBi and
other related compounds [16, 29, 34, 36, 40], a dramatic
onset of strong MR develops at low temperatures and
presents astonishingly high and unsaturating MR values
attributed to the opening of an energy gap by magnetic
fields at the band-touching point. In BaAl4, we also ob-
serve similar behavior, with a large upturn in resistivity
at low temperatures that tends to saturate. Fig. 4(b)
presents the transverse MR for Sample B with current
applied parallel to the ab plane and field along the c axis,
showing a quadratic evolution with field that does not
saturate up to at least 35 T. MR exhibits an amplitude
correlated with crystal quality (shown in Fig. S2 of sup-
plementary materials). For Sample A with the highest
RRR ∼ 1500, the MR approaches 2 × 105% at 14 T
(shown in Fig. 4(a) and also in Fig. S2 of supplemen-
tary materials), a value comparable to that reported in
Cd3As2, the TaAs family and other TSMs (including LaP
with P=Sb and Bi, WTe2, NbSb2 family). At higher
fields, the MR does not saturate, as shown for Sample
B data up to 35 T, where MR approaches 106% (FIG.
4(b)).
As shown in Fig. 4(c), the Hall resistivity ρxy is pos-
itive above 50 K and nearly linear with field, indicating
holes as the majority carriers at high temperatures. How-
ever, ρxy deviates from linear at temperatures below 50
K, and even changes sign at low temperature and high
field, indicating a coexistence of electrons and holes. It
has been proposed that the extremely large MR in several
semimetals arises due to a perfect compensation between

coexistence of electron and hole pockets. The hole pock-
ets (see Fig. 5(a)) corresponding to the Dirac point along

cylinders surrounding the Z points, while the electron

shown in Fig. 5(b). However, the volume surrounded
by the hole and electron pockets are different. To esti-
mate the carrier densities and mobility, a semi-classical
two-band model is used to analyze the longitudinal con-
ductivity σxx(B) and Hall conductivity σxy(B) in the
magnetic fields B:
σxx(B) =
neqµe
1+(µeB)2

σxx(0)−neqµe

σxy(B) =
[
neµ
2
e
1+(µeB)2
− nhµ

h

]
eB. (2)
Here ne (µe) and nh (µh) are the carrier densities (mo-
bilities) of electrons and holes, respectively. σxx(0) is the
longitudinal conductivity at 0 T. The typical fitting re-
sults at several different temperatures are shown in Fig.
S3 (a) and (b) in the Supplementary Materials, and the
fitting parameters are shown in Fig. 4(d,e) in tempera-
ture range 2 K ∼ 50 K. At low temperatures, holes are
the minority carriers, but their mobility is nearly one or-
der higher than the mobility of electrons. At 2 K, µh
approaches ∼ 20 m2/Vs. With increasing temperature,
µh decreases significantly and becomes comparable to µe.
Hence, the minority hole carriers dominate the transport
in the entire temperature range because of their high mo-
bility. This is consistent with the calculated electronic
structure, where the Dirac pockets have hole character-
istics.
Quantum oscillations measurements further clarify the
nature of carriers in BaAl4. As shown in Fig. 4(b),
the measured MR of several BaAl4 crystals exhibit clear
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Subtracting a back-
ground MR yields an oscillatory signal composed of sev-
eral components observable down to a few Teslas, as
shown in Fig. 5(c). The oscillation frequencies of differ-
ent pockets in the calculated Fermi surface are extracted
by finding the supercell k-space extremal area imple-
8
mented in the SKEAF code [58] and are compared to the
frequencies by Fourier transform analysis of the exper-
imental curves, correspondingly the oscillation frequen-
cies got by Fourier transform of our experiment curves
(in FIG. 5(d)) are assigned to different pockets the cal-
culated Fermi surface. Our experimental results are in
consistent with the calculated Fermi surface shown in
Fig. 5(a-b), and also most of them are close to the pre-
vious report reports [47], as shown in Table IV of SM. In
the high frequency region as shown in the inset of Fig.
5(d), the frequency Fβ ∼ 2.5 kT corresponds to the elec-
tron pocket shown in Fig. 5(b), and the other frequency
Fα4 ∼ 1.6 kT corresponds to the outer branch of the
hole pocket surrounding Γ point in Fig. 5(a). A small
frequency Fα3 ∼ 300 T corresponds to the inner branch
of the hole pocket. Besides these frequencies already ob-
served in Ref. [47] where a detailed angular dependence
of these frequencies consistent with calculated Fermi sur-
face is reported, two very close oscillation frequencies
Fα1 ∼ 100 T and Fα2 ∼ 106 T which are missing in pre-
vious report[47], are observed. These two close frequen-
cies give a clear beating behavior shown in Fig. 5, and
correspond to the small hole pockets along Γ −X lines.
Lifshitz-Kosevich analysis of the temperature-dependent
oscillation amplitude (Fig. S4 of SM) for these two fre-
quencies Fα1 and Fα2 reveals a similar effective mass of
∼ 0.2(1)me. This small effective mass of the hole pockets
is consistent with the calculated hole-like Dirac spectrum
(with a mass of about 0.15me, shown in Table IV of SM)
and the ARPES measurement.
Discussion and Conclusions
Quantum oscillations, Hall resistivity and ARPES re-
sults reveal that although the electron and hole pockets
coexist in BaAl4, they harbor different densities. This
implies that some other mechanism beyond the perfect
compensation between electron and hole pockets should
govern the extremely large MR found in BaAl4, which
may be related to the Dirac spectra as discussed for other
TSMs. The extremely small residual resistivity ∼ 90
nΩ cm is quite anomalous given the low carrier den-
sity ∼ 1020 cm−3, and is similar to the case for other
topological semimetals such as WTe2 (∼ 30nΩ · cm)
and La(Bi,Sb) (∼ 0.1µΩ · cm), suggesting a topology-
derived mechanism for reduction in scattering and large
MR [29, 59]. Although the Fermi surface is about 0.4 eV
away form the Dirac points, the winding feature of the
Wilson loop spectrum can still b stabilized by the C4z
symmetry. FIG. 5 shows the Wilson loop spectrum on a
spherical surface enclosing the Dirac point (0, 0, kcz) (e)
and the phase ϕj of the individual loop eigenvalues (e
iϕj )
as a function of the azimuthal angle θ (f). On a given-
θ Wilson loop, (rṡin(θ)cos(φ), rṡin(θ)sin(φ), kz(θ)) with
kz(θ) = k
c
z + rċos(274) and the spherical radius r, the
Wilson loop is mapped as C4zW2π←0C

, where WB←A represents a parallel
transport from φ = A to φ = B. Then we can redefine a
symmetry ς4z = W
−1
π

←0C4z, which yield ς4zW2π←0ς

we use ς4z = W

−iϕj . Our further calcula-
tions show that the ς4z eigenvalue of the blue(red) line is
λ2e
−i
ϕj
4 (λ3e

ϕj
4 ). Thus, those two Wilson eigenstates
can not hybridize with each other, giving rise to a stable
crossing in the Wilson loop spectrum. As long as the sur-
face states are C4z symmetric, the winding feature of the
Wilson loop spectrum is stable. This could, for instance
affect the bulk transport properties, but requires further
investigation.
Our results indicate BaAl4 as a new topological
semimetal, as confirmed by calculations, symmetry anal-
ysis, photoemission and transport experiments. Since a
large diversity of physical phenomena appears in com-
pounds derived from this prototype structure, one can
consider the MA4 family as a new playground for ex-
ploring the interaction between the non-trivial topology
and symmetry-breaking or correlated phases, including
superconductivity, heavy fermion and quantum critical
systems, charge/spin density wave, etc.. It could also be
expected that some distortion/modification of the origi-
nal crystal structure in the derived structures will slightly
modify the topological electronic structure and induce
new phenomena. One interesting direction is to consider
the consequences of breaking the inversion symmetry to
achieve a non-centrosymmetric structure (e.g. LaPtSi3
and other materials), where band splitting could be ex-
pected to achieve Weyl or multiple-fermion states [3, 60].
Noncollinear magnetic order (such as in EuAl4) may
also induce band splitting, yielding other exotic topo-
logical states. Extending the symmetry analysis to the
rest of the MA4 family of materials (M=Sr, Ba, Eu;
A=Al,Ga,In), as well as the enormous set of derivative
structures[27], will expose new topological materials.
METHODS
Crystal growth
Single crystals of BaAl4 were synthesized by a high-
temperature self-flux method. Chunks of Ba (99.98%,
Alfa Aesar) and pieces of Al (99.999% metal basis, Alfa
Aesar) in the ratio of 2:98 were placed in the Canfield
alumina crucible set with a decanting frit (LSP ceram-
ics), sealed in the quartz ampule under partial Ar pres-
sure, heated to 1150 oC, held at that temperature for 6
h, cooled down at 3 degree/h to 950 oC with subsequent
decanting of the excess Al with the help of a centrifuge.
The crystals tend to grow with large faceted surfaces nor-
9
mal to the (001) crystallographic plane. X-ray diffrac-
tion data were taken at room temperature with Cu Kα
(λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation in a powder diffractometer.
Transport measurement
Electrical transport measurements up to 14 T were
conducted on polished samples in a Quantum Design
Physical Properties Measurement System (Dynacool) ap-
plying the conventional four-wire contact method. High
field MR and dHvA oscillation were measured at the Na-
tional High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) Tal-
lahassee DC Field Facility up to 35 T, using a one-axis
rotator in a He-3 cryostat with temperature range 0.35
K ∼ 70 K. In all transport measurements, the electrical
current flowing in the ab-plane. The magnetization and
dHvA oscillations were measured using a piezoresistive
cantilever. The magnetic field rotated from a direction
parallel to the c-axis to a direction parallel to the ab-
plane.
Photoemission measurement
ARPES measurements on single crystalline samples
of BaAl4 were performed at the Beamline 4.0.3 (MER-
LIN) of the Advanced Light Source in Berkley, California.
Samples were cleaved in situ to yield clean (001) surfaces
and measured at 14–20 K in ultra high vacuum better
than 3 × 10−11 Torr using photon energy of 80-120 eV
with Scienta R4000 analyzer. The energy resolution was
20-30 meV and the angular resolution was better than
0.2◦ for all measurements. The inner potential V0 = 10.5
eV was used to calculate the momentum perpendicular
to the surface.
DFT calculation
Theoretical calculations compared to ARPES were
performed within generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) [61] for bulk BaAl4 as implemented in the VASP
package [62–64], using a relativistic version of PAW
potentials[65, 66]. The experimental crystal data (a =
b = 4.566Åand c = 11.278Å) were used for the bulk
calculation. PAW pseudopotentials with a plane wave
energy cut-off of 40 Ry were used, and Monkhorst k-
mesh was chosen as 24 × 24 × 24. All calculations pre-
pared by VASP were double checked by the QUANTUM
ESPRESSO Package[67, 68].

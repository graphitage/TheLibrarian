We analyze the robustness of corner modes in topological photonic crystals, taking a C6-symmetric
breathing honeycomb photonic crystal as an example. First, we employ topological quantum chem-
istry and Wilson loop calculations to demonstrate that the topological properties of the bulk crystal
stem from an obstructed atomic limit phase. We then characterize the topological corner modes
emerging within the gapped edge modes employing a semi-analytical model, determining the ap-
propriate real space topological invariants. For the first time, we provide a detailed account of the
effect of long-range interactions on the topological modes in photonic crystals, and we quantify their
robustness to perturbations. We conclude that, while photonic long-range interactions inevitably
break chiral symmetry, the corner modes are protected by lattice symmetries.
Introduction.— Photonic topological insulators host
protected boundary modes that are robust against a
range of defects and imperfections [1]. While the paradig-
matic case of two-dimensional (2D) topological pho-
tonic crystals (PhCs) hosting one-dimensional (1D) edge
modes immune to back-scattering has been extensively
studied [2], a hierarchy of protected boundary states of
lower dimensionality are possible in higher-order topo-
logical insulators (HOTIs) [3]. For instance, quantized
quadrupole insulators in 2D, which were introduced in
a generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model
to a square lattice with a flux [3], host 1D edge states,
as well as zero-dimensional (0D) corner modes. These
higher-order topological modes (HOTMs) localized at the
0D corners of a 2D lattice benefit from topological pro-
tection. Just as HOTIs in condensed matter systems are
characterized by charge fractionalization due to a filling
anomaly of the bulk states [4–7], classical wave HOTIs
reveal an analogous fractional corner anomaly of the den-
sity of states [8]. In systems with short-range hoppings
and approximate chiral symmetry, these corner modes
are mid-gap states [9, 10].
HOTMs have been realised in a variety of classi-
cal systems including PhCs [11–14], coupled photonic
waveguides [15–17], phononic crystals [18], acoustic sys-
tems [19–21], elastic systems [22] and microwave cir-
cuits [23], and their robustness has been exploited for
stable lasing [24–26]. However, a rigorous study of the
effect of long-range interactions (the coupling between el-
ements) which is unavoidable in many photonic systems
[14, 27–29], as well as a detailed analysis of the robustness
of the HOTMs has not been undertaken. Here we con-
sider a PhC with a C6-symmetric lattice [15, 30], and fill
the aforementioned gap by taking advantage of a semi-
analytical model with long-range interactions [31], that

is, interactions beyond nearest neighbours between all the
lattice elements. This allows us to perform an extensive
study of the robustness of these modes against defects
and imperfections. Crucially, we show that the HOTMs
are protected by lattice symmetries; we quantify their
degree of robustness against chiral-symmetry breaking
long-range interactions, as well as to strong defects.
Photonic crystal.— We consider the breathing honey-
comb PhC introduced in Ref. [30], Fig. 1(a). Each unit
cell in the triangular lattice consists of six silicon rods
(ε = 11.7) in vacuum of radius r = 0.12a0 located at
a distance R = R0(1 ± δ) from the origin of the unit
cell. Here, a0 is the lattice parameter, and R0 = a0/3

arrangement. The perturbation of the honeycomb lattice
of rods by ±δ yields expanded and contracted phases, re-
spectively, where the doubly degenerate Dirac point at Γ
splits and a bulk band gap opens between ωa/(2πc) = 0.4
to 0.5. Although this band gap hosts 1D edge states
as measured in several photonic experiments [33–39], we
now discuss how they are not an instance of a Z2 topo-
logical insulator [40].
Figure 1(b) presents the band structure of the ex-
panded phase for δ = 0.11. We first determine the topo-
logical properties of the system though the application of
topological quantum chemistry [41, 42]. The irreducible
representations of the eigenfields at the high symmetry
points (irrep labels), displayed in the band structure, are
calculated using GTPack [43, 44]. Using the catalogue
of Elementary Band Representations (EBRs) in the Bil-
bao Crystallographic Server [41, 45–49], along with the
irrep labels we can identify the topological properties of
each set of connected bands of our PhC. Counting from
ω = 0, bands 4-6 are all interconnected and their irrep
labels are accordant to Wannier functions centered in the
3c Wyckoff position transforming in the (E1 ↑ G)3c band
representation. Since these bands can be identified with
an EBR, we can conclude that the system presents a triv-
ial Z2 topological invariant. Nevertheless, the 3c Wyck-
off position of the band representation indicates that the
Wannier functions of this set of bands are not centered
around the origin of the unit cell, but at their edges. This
situation can be understood as a 2D analog of the topo-
logical hybridization of eigenstates of a 1D SSH chain.
This topological phase was labeled in the past in anal-
ogy with solid-state systems as the photonic obstructed
atomic limit (OAL), because although an atomic limit
exists it is ‘obstructed’ since the Wannier centers are not
located at the position where the photonic atoms sit [50].
Note that here the photonic atom is the collection of the
six contracted/expanded cylinders inside the unit cell.
Moreover, we characterize our system through the calcu-
lation of the eigenvalues of the Wilson loop [50] for this
set of connected bands, Fig. 1(c). The resulting Wilson
loops present no windings (which are characteristic of Z2
or Chern insulators), but the Wannier centers are not
only localized in the origin of the unit cell (W = 0) as in
a trivial system, but also at its edges (W = ±π), indi-
cating that the system presents an obstruction similar to
the 1D SSH chain [51]. On the other hand, the PhC in
the contracted phase is a trivial photonic insulator. This
can be seen from the Wannier centers of the EBRs being
located at the origin of the unit cell (1a Wyckoff posi-
tion), and by looking at the eigenvalues of Wilson loop
(see [32]).
It should be emphasized here that in 2D systems, there
is a subtle relationship between OAL and HOTIs. In toy
models with nearest neighbour interactions, it is often
possible to define a chiral symmetry, which forces the
spectrum to be symmetric about a fixed energy (often
taken to be zero in the literature). If an OAL model has
chiral symmetry, then it is sometimes possible to define a
bulk topological invariant which counts the number of 0D
corner modes in a finite-sized system preserving the crys-
tal symmetries [52]. Systems with non-zero values of this
invariant are properly termed HOTIs. In the absence of
chiral symmetry, as is the case in photonic systems with
long-range interactions, however, there is no guarantee
that a finite-sized system will have corner modes pinned
to a special frequency. These systems are regarded as
OAL systems, and can be characterized by the centers
of their Wannier functions (as above), by real-space in-
variants (see [32] and Ref. [53]), or a filling anomaly (see
[32] and Refs. [5, 6]). In order to make semi-analytical
predictions about the presence and robustness of corner
modes, for the remainder of this work we will exploit the
fact that our model is deformable to a chiral-symmetric
limit although this symmetry is strictly broken by un-
avoidable long-range interactions.
While the 0D corner modes in 2D SSH-like PhC
particles (that is, finite size crystals containing several
unit cells) with C4 symmetry have been extensively ex-
plored [11–13, 24, 25]. In photonic crystal particles with
C6 symmetry, only the 1D edge states have been stud-
ied [54–56]. Firstly, we analyze the emergence of 0D
photonic corner states in this system by looking at 2D
particles made of cells in the expanded phase and sur-
rounded by cells in the contracted phase, see Figs. 2(a)
and 2(b) [57]. Results of MPB supercell calculations [58]
are shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). The frequency eigenval-
ues 2(c) show a clear band-gap, with 6 mid-gap states.
The real part of the displacement field eigenvectorsDz for
these 6 states are shown in Fig. 2(d). These are concen-
trated at the corners of the particles, thus classify them
as corner modes — marked in red in Fig. 2(c). States
2A,B and 3A,B are degenerate pairs. The states imme-
diately above and below the bandgap can be classified as
edge states (cyan) [54–56], followed by bulk eigenstates
(gray). Thus, the 0D corner states in this PhC particle
are hosted within the gapped 1D edge states, in contrast
to HOTMs in C3- and C4-symmetric PhCs [12–14].
Coupled dipole model.— Since the spectrum of the
PhC particle is determined by lattice symmetries to-
gether with long-range interactions, we now exploit a
semi-analytical model to unveil the properties of corner
modes in a closely related nanophotonic system. The
coupled dipole model is a versatile method for investi-
gating the optical response of arrays of subwavelength
elements such as cold atoms or plasmonic nanoparticles
(NPs) [31]. Within this model we can reproduce all the
relevant features found in full field simulations of the PhC
topological particle. Then, we use it to shed further light
on the properties of the corner modes, particularly on
their robustness against disorder. This model goes be-
yond tight-binding, nearest neighbour models by includ-
ing interactions between all the lattice elements (exclud-

this formalism, the modes can be found by solving a gen-
eralised eigenvalue equation,

where pj are the dipole moments, Ĝ is the dyadic Green’s
function that describes dipole-dipole interactions, α is
the polarizability of the subwavelength elements, ω is
the frequency and the separation between NPs is dij =
di − dj . The specifics of the physical dipolar elements
enter through the polarizability, from which the reso-
nance frequencies of the modes can be extracted [32].
In Figs. 2(e) and 2(f) we present results of the dipole
model for the OAL particle with the same geometry as
the PhC in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). Here we particularise
the system to the out-of-plane modes of subwavelength
spheroidal metallic NPs, which correspond to the TM
modes in the PhC [59]. We take a quasistatic approxi-
mation, and only include the near-field interaction term
in the Green’s function (∝ 1/d3), which is accurate for
these subwavelength NPs. In this approximation, the
eigenvalues of Eq. (1), E = 1/α(ω), only depend on the
particular geometrical arrangement of the dipoles. Fig-
ure 2(e) shows the frequency spectrum around the band
gap with corner modes within the gapped edge and bulk
bands [60]. For the plasmonic system, zero eigenvalue
(E = 0) maps to ωLSP, the localized surface plasmon fre-
quency of the NPs. We see that the center of the band
gap is located close to but not exactly at ωLSP, and that
the spectrum is not exactly symmetric around that point.
This is a consequence of chiral-symmetry breaking due to
long-range interactions, as we discuss below in detail.
In Fig. 2(f) we plot the real space dipole moments
of the first mid-gap corner eigenmode, which reproduce
well the Dz field distributions of the PhC. Importantly,
the corner modes are localized on a particular sublat-
tice, while the dipole moments in the opposite sublat-
tice remain virtually zero, shown in Fig. 2(b). A similar
sublattice localization of coner modes is present in the
PhC, though weaker due to the fully retarded interac-
tions. Nevertheless, this shows that both systems are
approximately chiral-symmetric despite the long-range
interactions, which has implications on the robustness
of these 0D modes. In addition, these modes are well
separated from the gapped bulk and edge states and are
tightly confined to the corners.
We now use the coupled dipole model to better charac-
terise the properties of the corner modes. First, we study
the behaviour of the system as a function of δ, the devi-
ation the lattice of NPs away from a perfect honeycomb.
In Fig. 3(a), we plot the eigenvalue spectrum, such that
the symmetry properties of the spectrum around zero
eigenvalue are clearer. Starting from the unperturbed
honeycomb lattice (δ = 0), we see how increasing δ con-
trols the size of the bulk band-gap. At the same time,
the corner modes (red) stay at approximately constant
eigenvalue, only slightly shifted away from zero due to
the inherent breaking of chiral symmetry. In addition,
edge modes (cyan) appear at the edges of the bulk bands.
As δ increases, the corner modes are more isolated in the
band structure, and hence more strongly confined to cor-
ners of the particle. For δ & 0.12 new sets of corner
modes (magenta) emerge from the bulk for positive and
negative eigenvalues. In contrast to the corner modes
discussed here, these modes do not lie at the middle of
the gap, and they are not localized only on one of the
sublattices.
The coupled dipole model also enables us to analyze
the photonic corner modes analytically, as detailed in the
SM [32]. We find that when interactions are short-range,
the eigenvalue problem for the coupled dipoles maps onto
a tight-binding Schrödinger equation for a system with
six s-orbitals at the 6d Wyckoff position in the unit cell
(there is one s-orbital at the position of each NP). As δ

(grey) modes. Other corner modes are shown in magenta.

increases, the model undergoes a transition between an
atomic limit phase with Wannier centers on the 1a posi-
tion, to an OAL phase with Wannier centers on the 3c
position; in the short-range limit these Wannier functions
are compactly supported, and can be found exactly. For
a finite-sized system, the two atomic limits are distin-
guished by the p6mm real space invariants of Ref. [53],
which confirms that HOTMs are protected by lattice
symmetries. Furthermore, we can solve for the corner
modes in a topological particle in the long-wavelength
approximation. We find that the low-energy theory of
the domain between trivial and OAL particle naively re-
sembles the edge of a quantum-spin Hall (QSH) insulator
if only the lowest-order terms are considered. However,
when we include crystalline- and chiral-symmetric per-
turbations, we find that the QSH edge states gap to yield
six corner modes pinned to mirror lines and related by
sixfold rotational symmetry. Since the corner modes are
eigenstates of the chiral symmetry, they must be local-
ized to a single sublattice. We can then include chiral
symmetry breaking perturbatively to find that the cor-
ner modes are lifted from zero eigenvalue (or ω = ωLSP),
consistent with calculations as we discuss next.
We study the effect of long-range interactions by intro-
ducing an artificial cut-off in the coupled dipole model.
We introduce an exponential decay to the dipole-dipole
interactions, fc.o.(dij) = exp
[
−(dij − d0ij)/(d0ijγ)
]
, where
d0ij is the nearest neighbour separation for each dipole
and γ is a cut-off parameter to control the interaction
range [32]. This allows us to continuously tune the
interaction range from nearest neighbours (γ = 0.1),
to electronic-like exponentially suppressed ones, all the
way to full dipolar interactions (γ ≈ 5), as we show in
Fig. 3(b) for fixed δ = 0.2. For small values of γ, inter-
actions in practice are only between nearest neighbours,
such that there is no coupling between dipoles of the same
sublattice. This preserves chiral symmetry and results
in a spectrum that is symmetric about zero eigenvalue,
with six degenerate topological corner modes (red) that
are pinned at zero.
Increasing the range of the interaction breaks chiral
symmetry through coupling of elements in the same sub-
lattice. This shifts the corner modes away from zero
eigenvalue, lifts their degeneracy (from six degenerate
states to 1+2+2+1, as in Fig. 2), and removes the sym-
metry of the spectrum about zero eigenvalue [or ω =
ωLSP in Fig. 2(e)]. Finally, it is interesting to note that
the other set of corner modes (magenta) are not pinned at
zero even for nearest neighbour interactions. This is dif-
ferent from the type II corner states identified in Ref. [14]
for the breathing kagome lattice, which emerge due to
long-range interactions.
Robustness against defects and disorder.— We now
take advantage of the coupled dipole model to test the
degree of protection of the corner modes against defects.
Hence, we quantify protection by evaluating if the num-
ber of states within the band gap, together with the sym-
metries and degeneracies they satisfy, are left invariant.
First, we create a strong defect in the crystal by remov-
ing one lattice site next to the corner of the particle,
Fig. 4(a). Since this breaks the C6 and mirror symme-
tries that protect the corner modes, one of them disap-
pears and the remaining five satisfy new symmetry re-
lations and degeneracies, see field plots and eigenvalue
spectrum in Fig. 4(a). Next, we consider removing one
lattice site at exactly the corner Fig. 4(b), breaking the
C6 symmetry but respecting one mirror symmetry. Re-
markably, the corner states are robust against this de-
fect: there are 6 mid-gap states and they satisfy the same
symmetries and degeneracies as before the perturbation.
This is a consequence of the system being deformable
to a chirally-symmetric system. Despite the presence of
long-range interactions, the modes still sit on alternate
sublattices, and the mode intensity is virtually zero at
the removed lattice site.
Finally, we test robustness against random positional
disorder. In Fig. 4(c) we consider a system with maxi-
mum 5% random disorder in lattice sites. Crucially, this
breaks the C6 symmetry across the whole lattice, such
that the degeneracies of the corner modes are lifted, and
each of the six mid-gap states localizes at one of the cor-
ners. On the other hand, we see in the spectrum how,
despite the other corner modes and edge modes being
lost to the bulk, the mid-gap corner modes remain well
isolated at mid-gap energies. For practical purposes they
are robust against random spatial perturbations. This is
confirmed in Fig. 4(d), where we plot a close up of the
band gap and the HOTMs for increasing random posi-
tional disorder, up to a maximum of 10%.

symmetry breaking defect in the lattice affects the mid-gap
corner modes. (b) The corner states are robust against an-

modes being close to chiral-symmetric. (c) The degeneracy of
the corner modes is lifted by random disorder: the position of

spectrum for increasing positional disorder.
Conclusions.— We have studied the emergence of
topologically protected corner modes in breathing hon-
eycomb PhC particles. By analyzing the lattice through
topological quantum chemistry, Wilson loops and the
calculation of real space topological invariants, we con-
clude that the topological properties emerge from an ob-
structed atomic limit phase, which in 2D is reminiscent
of higher-order topology. Finally, we quantify the ro-
bustness of topological corner modes in PhCs to different
kinds of perturbations. We conclude that, while long-
range interactions inevitably break chiral symmetry, the
corner modes are still protected by lattice symmetries.
Although we have focused here on the breathing hon-
eycomb lattice PhC, our analysis applies to all classical
wave systems.

BULK BAND STRUCTURES AND WILSON LOOPS
Here we present the unit cell arrangements, as well as the band structure and the Wilson loops characterization for
the lowest bands of the expanded and contracted lattice. The Wilson loops for the expanded lattice show that the
Wannier functions are centered at the 3c position, whereas for the contracted lattice they are centered at 1a.

COUPLED DIPOLE MODEL
In the quasistatic (QS) approximation, we consider an array of point dipoles and model interactions between the
them using the coupled dipole method [S1]. In the absence of an external electric field, the (electric) dipole moment
at position di due to a dipole at position dj is given by,
1
α(ω)
pi = Ĝ(dij , ω) · pj , (S1)
where ω is the frequency and the separation between dipoles is dij = di − dj . The dyadic Green’s function, which
describes the dipole-dipole interaction; it can be written as:

QS approximation, we retain only the quickly decaying 1/d3 terms in the Green’s function by letting k → 0. Then
for a periodic array of dipoles, we can we write the following eigenvalue equation,
(

with Bloch wavevector kB and lattice sites R = na1+ma2, where the lattice vectors are defined in the main text. The
dipole model accurately describes a nanophotonic system of resonators such as metallic nanoparticles (NPs), provided
the NP radius satisfies r < 3R, where R is the nearest neighbour spacing. The optical response of an individual NP
is given by the polarizability α(ω). In the following, we assume a static polarizability,
α(ω) =

permittivity is written,

In this manuscript, we use silver spheroidal NPs with material parameters �∞ = 5, ωp = 8.9 eV and size parameters
radius r = 10 nm, height h = 40 nm. [S3] The spheroidal shape causes the in-plane and out-of-plane resonances of
the NP to split in frequency and become completely decoupled, meaning we can consider them separately. To make
comparisons with the 2D photonic crystal, we only consider the out-of-plane interactions and take the ẑẑ component
of the dyadic in Eq. (S2), Ĝ(dij , ω) = −1/r3. The size of the interaction matrix in will then be N ×N where N is the
number of elements in the supercell. Additionally, to model a finite system we only consider normal incidence and
solve the eigenvalue problem at Γ, kB = (0, 0).
TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE QUASISTATIC MODEL: REAL SPACE INVARIANTS
To analyze the topological properties of our nanophotonic resonator (coupled dipole) system, we can reinterpret
the interaction matrix Hij of the quasistatic model as a (long-ranged) Hamiltonian for a topological phase transition.
While Hij is in general long range (it has power-law decaying matrix elements in position space) which can lead to
cusp singularities in the band structure (which are removed when a fully retarded Green’s function is used), we can
nevertheless probe the presence and topological protection of edge and corner modes originating from analytic regions
in the band structure. To this end, we can truncate the interaction matrix at the nearest neighbor level. Doing
so, we can reinterpret Hij as a tight-binding model for dipolar resonators at the 6d Wyckoff position in space group
p6mm. In reduced coordinates, the positions of the dipoles are q0 = (s, 0), q1 = (s,−s), q2 = (0,−s), q3 = (−s, 0), q4 =
(−s, s), q5 = (0, s). In the basis of these six orbitals, the C6 symmetry is represented by
ρ(C6) =

and time-reversal symmetry is represented by complex conjugation. We can write the interaction matrix Hij as the
sum of two terms
H(k, s) = (1− t(s))M + t(s)N(k) (S9a)
where
M =

Here M is the intra-cell hopping matrix, and N is the inter-cell hopping matrix. Note that this is written in an
embedding where we keep the positions of the dipoles fixed at s = 0, while we vary the hoppings t(s) in accordance
with the analysis of the main text (c.f. the treatment of the Peierls transition in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model [S4]).
The function t(s) smoothly and monotonically interpolates between t(0) = 0 in the maximally contracted (triangular)
lattice, and t(1) = 1 in the maximally expanded (kagome) lattice. There is a critical point t(s∗) = 1/2, where the
intra- and inter-cell hopping amplitudes are equal. H(k, s) has a gap at zero energy for all k and all s 6= s∗, with
three negative and three positive energy bands.
We will now proceed to show that the critical point separates the trivial and obstructed atomic limit phases of
our model. First, we will compute the band representations carried by the occupied (negative energy) states in both
gapped phases, and show that there is a transition between a phase with Wannier centers at the 1a position, and a
phase with Wannier centers at the 3c position. Furthermore, we will show that the little group representations in
these phases are consistent with what is found in the photonic crystal model. Then we will compute the “real space
invariants[S5]” for the trivial and OAL phases, and show that point group symmetric topological particles in the two
phases are topologically distinct. Finally, by analyzing the low-energy theory of the critical point H(k, s∗+δs) we will
show that the interface between the trivial and topological phase must host a set of six corner states of topological
origin.
Band representation analysis
Here we will establish that the Hamiltonians H(k, s < s∗) and H(k, s > s∗) describe topologically distinct atomic
limits. To do so, let us note that, since H(k, s) is gapped for all s 6= s∗, we can always adiabatically deform the
Hamiltonian either to s = 0 or s = 1. It is thus sufficient to determine the topology of the bands when s = 0, 1.
Let us focus first on s = 0, where we have
H(k, 0) = M. (S10)

We can easily diagonalize the k-independent matrix to find that the three occupied (E < 0) states have eigenvectors
v1 =
1√

(1,−1, 1,−1, 1,−1)T , (S11a)
v2 =

v3 =
1
2
(0, 1,−1, 0, 1,−1)T , (S11c)
with corresponding energies
E1 = −2, E2 = E3 = −1 (S12)
Since these eigenvectors give us k-independent linear combinations of our basis orbitals, they can be Fourier trans-
formed to yield exponentially localized (in fact, delta-function localized) Wannier functions at the 1a position of
the unit cell. To determine the band representation under which these Wannier functions transform, we project the
symmetry operations into the space of occupied states to obtain the sewing matrices
B(0)(C6)ij ≡ 〈vi|ρ(C6)|vj〉 =

Comparing with the character tables on the Bilbao Crystallographic server, we see that this is the B2 ⊕E2 represen-
tation of the site-symmetry group G1a ≈ p6mm of the 1a Wyckoff position. Hence, when s = 0 the occupied bands
transform in the (B2 ⊕ E2)1a ↑ G band representation[S6–S8].
Next, let us analyze the case when s = 1, where the Hamiltonian takes the form
H(k, 1) = N(k) (S14)
We can diagonalize N(k) to obtain the three occupied-band eigenvectors, which now have energies E1 = E2 = E3 =
−1,
w1 =
1√

(0, 0,−e−ik2 , 0, 0, 1)T (S15a)

w3 =
1√

(−eik1 , 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)T (S15c)
Although these eigenvectors are k-dependent, they are periodic and analytic, and hence can be Fourier transformed to
yield compactly-supported Wannier functions. In this case, we can see from computing the position matrix elements
〈wi|x|wj〉 = −i〈wi|∇kwj〉 (S16)
that these Wannier functions will be centered at the 3c Wyckoff position, with reduced coordinates (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2),
(1/2, 1/2). To determine under which band representation these Wannier functions transform, we can again compute
the sewing matrices for the symmetry operations, yielding
B(1)(C6)ij ≡ 〈wi(C6k)|ρ(C6)|wj(k)〉 =
1
2


0 0 −eik1



0 −ei(k1−k2) 0
−e−ik2 0 0
0 0 1

 . (S17b)
Specializing to the high-symmetry points, we can verify that these are the sewing matrices obtained via induction
from the B1 representation of the site symmetry group G3c ≈ p2mm of the 3c Wyckoff position. Thus, when s = 1
the occupied bands transform in the (B1)3c ↑ G band representation. Thus, we have verified that as the parameter
s is tuned, the Hamiltonian H(k, s) describes an obstructed atomic limit transition between the 1a and 3c Wyckoff
positions.

Real Space Invariants
Having established the presence of a bulk OAL transition for the Hamiltonian H(k, s), we know that bulk systems
with s < s∗ are topologically distinct from bulk systems with s > s∗. We would like to extend this analysis, however,
to the case of finite-sized topological particles, and hence establish that the topological particles for the two different
bulk phases are topologically distinguishable. To do this, we will employ the method of Real Space Invariants (RSIs)
presented in Ref. [S5]. In that work, it was shown that there exist point group invariants which distinguish the classes
of occupied states of a topological particle that can be deformed into each other through point group symmetric
deformations of the Hamiltonian, as well as point-group symmetric addition of states from outside the topological
particle. While these invariants are most generally formulated in terms of real-space point group irreps, in many cases
they can be calculated from the momentum-space irreps of a band structure. In p6mm, there are seven invariants
which can be computed in terms of the multiplicities of momentum-space irreps: they are
δ1,1a = n(M3)− n(K1)− n(Γ2) (S18a)
δ2,1a = n(Γ3) + n(Γ5)− n(Γ2)− n(K1) (S18b)
δ3,1a = n(Γ3)− 2n(Γ2)− n(Γ6)− n(K1) + n(K2) + n(M3) (S18c)
δ1,2b = n(K1)− n(Γ1)− n(Γ3) (S18d)
δ1,3c = n(Γ3) + n(Γ6)− n(M3) (S18e)
δ1,6d = n(K2) = n(K1) (S18f)
δ1,6e = 2n(Γ2)− 2n(Γ1) + n(K1)− n(K2) (S18g)
where n(ρ) is the multiplicity of the little group representation ρ in the set of occupied bands. Note that each RSI is
labelled by a Wyckoff position, indicating that it is an invariant computed from the set of orbitals localized to that
Wyckoff position in the topological particle.
For the case at hand, as s is tuned from 0 to 1, our Hamiltonian undergoes a band inversion at the Γ point. From
the sewing matrices computed above, we find that as we tune from the trivial to the OAL phase, n(Γ5) decreases by
1, while n(Γ6) increases by 1. This implies that the real space invariants δ2,1a, δ3,1a, and (−)δ1,3c each differ by (−)1
between the trivial and the OAL phases. This implies that even in a finite-sized topological particle, the trivial and
OAL phases can be distinguished by their transformation properties under the point group 6mm. We now analyze
the consequences of this distinguishability in terms of corner states.
Corner states
The key consequence of the topological distinction between the trivial and obstructed topological particles is the
presence of protected corner states at a point-group symmetric boundary between the two phases. To see that the
corner states are an inevitable consequence of the bulk topology, we will here adapt the method of Ref. [S9] to
analyze the low-energy theory of the topological particle system. This does not alter the topological properties of the
Hamiltonian, but will simplify the analysis below. To begin, we replace the matrix M with the spectrally flattened
M̃ = I− 2
3∑
i=1
vi ⊗ vi, (S19)
which shares the same negative energy eigenspace as the matrix M , but moves all states to the same eigenvalue
E1 = E2 = E3 = 1. We can then focus on the deformed Hamiltonian
H̃(k, s) = (1− t(s))M̃ + t(s)N(k) (S20)
Our strategy here is to expand the Hamiltonian about the band-inversion point (Γ, s∗), Fourier transform to position
space, and allow the mass parameter s to be spatially varying with s(R) = s∗, where R � 1. We will then perform
a Jackiw-Rebbi analysis of the boundary states near r ≈ R, and analyze their stability to perturbations of the bulk
Hamiltonian. Following this procedure, we will establish the existence of corner modes and a filling anomaly for our
OAL topological particles even in the absence of chiral symmetry.
Let us project the Hamiltonian near k = 0, s = s∗ into the low-energy subspace of the topological band inversion.
We find that at the gap-closing point, there is a fourfold band degeneracy at the Γ point. This fourfold degenracy is
6
the critical point between the trivial and OAL phases. Diagonalizing the critical Hamiltonian H̃(0, s∗) = M̃ + N(0)
at the Γ point, we find that the space of states at the critical point is spanned by the four zero-energy eigenvectors
u1 =
1√
2
(0,−1, 0, 0, 0, 1)T , (S21)
u2 =

u4 =

(−1, 0, 2, 0,−1, 0)T (S24)
After a suitable transformation to Cartesian coordinates, we can expand the Hamiltonian to first order in k and
m = t(s)− t(s∗) to find the Dirac-like Hamiltonian
H̃(k, δs) ≈ 1

We will now let m → m(r) depend on position. To be concrete, we assume that m(r → 0) = −t0,m(r → ∞) =
t0,m(r = R) = 0, and we furthermore assume that m(r) = m(r) is circularly symmetric. We will look for zero-energy

We would like to look for solutions to this equation near r = R, where the mass changes sign. for R sufficiently large,
we can then treat the angular dispersion term 1/r∂θ ≈ 1/R∂θ as a small perturbation. We will then find the spectrum
of edge states by first solving
[−2m(r)Γz − iσyτ1(θ)∂r] f(r)|φ〉 = 0, (S30)
from which we will derive a low-energy edge Hamiltonian by projecting the angular velocity into this eigenbasis.
Equation (S30) is solved by functions of the form

We have chosen this basis because it yields particularly simple projections of the symmetry operations:
〈φi(θ)|TR|φj(θ)〉 = sx (S34)
〈φi(θ + π/3)|C6|φj(θ)〉 = exp(iπsz/3) (S35)
〈φi(−θ)|mx|φj(θ)〉 = −sx, (S36)
where we have introduced Pauli matrices si acting in the space of |φi〉. Using this basis, we can project the angular
dispersion into the space of low-lying edge states to find the effective Hamiltonian

which is the Hamiltonian for a pair of counter-propagating edge excitations. The term proportional to the identity
accounts for the fact that our topological particle geometry has a constant-curvature edge[S9]; we will neglect it in
the following as it does not contribute to our topological analysis.
At first glance, Eq. (S37) resembles the edge theory for the helical states of a two-dimensional topological insulator.
In fact, the low-energy critical point Eq. (S25) coincides with the critical theory of a 2D TI. This observation led Wu
and Hu to predict that topological particles such as ours should have a Z2 invariant with gapless counterpropagating
edge states [S11]. However, there is a fundamental distinction between our model and a two-dimensional TI due to
the symmetries we require. To analyze the edge of our topological particle system, we should include higher-order
terms in the bulk that preserve the 6mm point group symmetry, and ask what effect they have on the edge dispersion.
Here, we will focus only on terms that cannot close a bulk gap, and that simultaneously gap the edge theory (S37).
This means we look for potentials V (θ) that anticommute with both the bulk mass mΓz and the edge kinetic term
σyτ2(θ). However, we also require that V (θ) commute with Γzσyτ1(θ), in order that 〈φi|V (θ)|φj〉 6= 0. We find that
this restricts the form of V (θ) to
V (θ) = m4(θ)Γ4 +m5(θ)Γ5, (S38)
where we have introduced Γ5 = iΓxΓyΓzΓ4. Crucially, both Γ4 and Γ5 anticommute with the sewing matrices for C6
and mx, we find:
〈wi|C6|wj〉 =

Accounting for the action of the symmetries on the angular coordinate θ, we can thus write a Fourier expansion
V (θ) =
∑
n
m4n sin((3 + 6n)θ)Γ4 +m5n cos((3 + 6n)θ), (S40)
where n indexes the different Fourier harmonics. Projecting these onto the edge, we find that the edge Hamiltonian
becomes

Let us focus on the case when only the n = 0 masses are nonzero. To analyze this, we will without loss of generality
take m40 6= 0, m50 = 0 to start, and then we will perturbatively reintroduce m50: the mass term m40 sin(3θ) vanishes

Near each zero we have corner states which satisfy

[
∂θ + 3im40(−1)mszθ
(
0 ie−iθm
−ieiθm 0

|Θm〉 = 0, (S42)
and so repeating our Jackiw-Rebbi analysis we find a zero-energy corner state satisfying
im40(−1)mszθ
(
0 ie−iθm
−ieiθm 0
)
|Θm〉 = (−1)m+1|Θm〉,
yielding a total of six zero-energy corner states. We thus see that symmetry-allowed mass terms gap the counterprop-
agating edge states of Ref. [S11], yielding corner states consistent with our MPB and coupled dipole simulations.
To complete the analysis, we next perturbatively restore m50. Projecting into the space of corner modes for each
m, we find
m50 cos(3θm)〈Θm|
(
0 e−iθ
eiθ 0
)
|Θm〉 = +m50. (S43)
This means that although m50 breaks chiral symmetry and shifts the corner modes away from zero energy, it does
not break the degeneracy of the corner modes. This leads to the so-called “filling anomaly”: when both m4 and m5
are nonzero, the difference between the number of states in the positive and negative energy subspaces of the model
is six.
Note that we could have performed our same analysis with m5 initially nonzero instead, which would result in corner
modes localized at θ′m = (2m + 1)π/3 (the other conjugacy class of mirror lines in the point group). Additionally,
we could have considered higher Fourier harmonics in the mass term, which would yield additional sets of 12 corner
modes at generic points along the boundary, which gap non-anomalously. Finally, our analysis holds as well for a
C2-symmetric topological particle, in which case we can add mass terms of the form Γ5 cos 2θ and Γ4 sin 2θ, which
gap all but one pair of corner modes, yielding a filling anomaly of 2. We can see an example of this in the topological
particle pictures in Fig. S2.
To conclude, let us comment on the applicability of our tight-binding calculation to the nanophotonic calculation.
Because the full interaction matrix contains power-law decaying terms in position space, we cannot guarantee a priori
that the Bloch Hamiltonian will permit a series expansion near the Γ point in the Brillouin zone. However, for our
model we find that the cusp singularities arising in the band structure due to the long-range hopping appear only in
the highest positive and lowest negative energy bands in the band structure (one of which maps to the cusp singularity
at ω = 0 in the full photonic model). Crucially, however, we have seen that it is only the bands close to the mid-gap
band inversion that contribute to the formation of corner states in this model. Thus, we expect that our analysis here
is robust to the inclusion of long range hoppings. It is an interesting open problem for future work to consistently
incorporate band structure singularities due to long-range hoppings into the general theory of topological photonic
systems.

TABLE I. Effect of different C6 breaking defects on the topological corner states for particles with long range interactions. For
a nearest neighbour model the corner states survive all perturbations except for the second corner defect type.
Table I summarizes the effect of different kinds of C6 symmetry breaking defects on the topological corner modes of
Types A and B particles: defects at corners, edges and random bulk disorder are considered. From the main text, the
6 degenerate corner modes survive when one particle belonging to the sublattice immediately at the corner is removed,
even if C6 symmetry is broken. All the other defects have an effect to some extent as shown in the table. In contrast,
in a nearest neighbour model the topological corner modes are robust against all the perturbations considered in the
table (except if one of the particles at the corner where the mode resides is removed). The effect on the topological
robustness of the corner modes then emerges both from the spatial symmetries and the range of the interactions. At
the critical point s∗, the Hamiltonian H(k, s) is gapless with a fourfold Dirac degeneracy at the Γ (k = 0) point.
These results hold true regardless of the edge termination, provided the particle has the same lattice symmetries. It
should be noted that corner modes in particles with complete unit cells at the interface are more strongly affected by
edge and bulk disorder, compared to the broken unit cell interface termination presented in the main text. This is
due to the longer localization length of these modes.

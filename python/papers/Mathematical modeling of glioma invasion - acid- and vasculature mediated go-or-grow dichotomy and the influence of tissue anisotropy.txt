Abstract
Starting from kinetic transport equations and subcellular dynamics we deduce a multiscale model for
glioma invasion relying on the go-or-grow dichotomy and the influence of vasculature, acidity, and brain
tissue anisotropy. Numerical simulations are performed for this model with multiple taxis, in order to
assess the solution behavior under several scenarios of taxis and growth for tumor and endothelial cells. An
extension of the model to incorporate the macroscopic evolution of normal tissue and necrotic matter allows
us to perform tumor grading.

1 Introduction
Glioma is the most frequent type of primary brain tumor. It originates from glia cells and accounts for 78
percent of malignant brain tumors, of which glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive, being
characterized by a fast, infiltrative spread and high proliferation. These features make it very difficult to treat,
and go along with a poor survival prognosis [34,93].
Like in most tumors, glioma development, growth, and invasion are influenced by a multitude of intrinsic
and extrinsic factors. Among these, the phenotypic heterogeneity and the biological, physical, and chemical
composition of the tumor microenvironment play a decisive role. Experiments with cultures of glioma cells
suggest mutual exclusion of migratory and proliferative behavior, as reviewed e.g. in [7, 26, 94]; this is known
as go-or-grow dichotomy [27,28]. Biological evidence indicates that migratory and proliferative processes share
common signaling pathways, suggesting a unique intracellular mechanism that regulates both phenotypes [26].
Hypoxia is a prominent trait of tumor microenvironment and glioma neoplasms are no exception. It has been
suggested (see e.g. [44,94] and references therein) that it is putatively influencing the phenotypic switch between
migrating and proliferating behavior - along with other regulating factors, like angiogenesis, ECM production
and degradation, etc. Indeed, glioma cells have been observed to move away from highly hypoxic sites created,
for instance, by the occlusion of a capillary and to form so-called pseudopalisade patterns, which are typical for
glioblastoma [10,11,92]. They have garland-like shapes exhibiting central necrotic zones surrounded by stacks of
tumor cells, most of which are actively migrating. As (tumor) cell proliferation is impaired at (too) low pH, this
seems to endorse the antagonistic relationship between (transiently) migratory and proliferative phenotypes [68].
While cancer cells are able to survive in relatively acidic regions by anaerobic glycolysis, which confers them an
advantage against normal cells [35, 90], the large amounts of lactate and alanine they produce during this pro-
cess can decrease the pH below critical levels. As a consequence, they initiate (re)vascularization by expressing
pro-angiogenic factors, in order to provide adequate supply with blood-transported nutrients [32,89]. They can
deter proliferation for migration towards more favorable areas [65,90], and the above mentioned pseudopalisade
formation is just one aspect of this complex behavior.
Previous models for glioma invasion have been proposed in (semi)discrete [9, 33, 53] or continuous frameworks.
Most of the latter are purely macroscopic, describing the evolution of glioma cell density under the influence
of surrounding tissue, chemical signals, and/or vasculature, see e.g. [37, 46, 56, 64, 86] and the review [3]; many

of them are versions or extensions of a model proposed by Murray [69]. More recent continuous models leave
behind the classical reaction-diffusion prototype and take into account advection bias of glioma cells in re-
sponse to environmental cues. Some of these are directly set on the macroscopic scale and rely on balance of
mass/flux/momentum [13, 42, 52], others are obtained by more detailed descriptions from lower scale dynam-
ics, as proposed in [71] and further developed in [14, 16, 19–21, 45, 57, 85]. In particular, some of the latter
have a multiscale character that is (partially) preserved during the upscaling process from kinetic transport
equations (mesoscale) to reaction-diffusion-taxis PDEs (macroscale). As mentioned above, hypoxia is an es-
sential factor in tumor evolution. Early mathematical models for cancer invasion and patterning under acidic
conditions were introduced in [23, 66, 80]. Further PDE-based models, that characterize acid-mediated tumor
development, directly related or applicable to pH-influenced glioma spread have been proposed and investigated
e.g. in [64] and [22, 67, 81], respectively. Instead, for stochastic multiscale settings see e.g. [38, 39, 41] and [40]
for a review also addressing further related models. Tumor heterogeneity has been usually modeled in the
continuous setting by describing the dynamics of the correspondingly defined subpopulations of cells, e.g. hy-
poxic/normoxic/necrotic [37,64,86] or moving/proliferating [21,25,45,67,74,82,96]. An indirect accounting for
a go-grow-recede heterogeneity under the influence of intra- and extracellular acidity was proposed and analyzed
in [39]; its numerical simulations were able to explain a large variety of invasion patterns.
The models in [21, 45] started from a mesoscopic description of glioma density functions for migrating, respec-
tively proliferating cells in interaction with the anisotropic brain tissue, whereby the latter took into account
subcellular dynamics of receptor binding to tissue fibers on the microscale. The cells were able to switch between
the two phenotypes, the corresponding rates being dependent on space and (in [45]) also on the doses of some
chemotherapeutic agent administered in order to impair cell motility. In this note we extend those settings by
including the dynamics of endothelial cells developing vasculature and of acidity, both being responsible for the
phenotypic switch. The upscaling of the kinetic transport PDEs for glioma and endothelial cells leads in the
parabolic limit to a system of reaction-advection-diffusion equations featuring several types of taxis, nonlinear
myopic diffusion of glioma, and highly complicated couplings between the variables of the model, which has a
multiscale character due to (some of) the taxis coefficients encoding information from the lower modeling levels.
The subsequent content is organized as follows. Section 2 is concerned with the setup of the model on the
subcellular and mesoscopic scales and with the deduction of the macroscopic PDEs. In Section 3 we concretize
the coefficient functions in preparation for the numerical simulations to be performed in Section 4. In order to
facilitate the evaluation of the tumor burden in relation to the necrotic and the normal tissue, Section 5 includes
a model extension accounting for the dynamics of the latter. We conclude with a discussion of the results in
Section 6. The Appendix contains the assessment of the model parameters and a nondimensionalization of the
macroscopic PDEs.
2 Modeling
Relying on the go-or-grow dichotomy, we consider a tumor containing two mutually exclusive subpopulations
of glioma cells, which are either migrating or proliferating. The respective states are transient, the tumor can
change dynamically its composition, according to the signals received by the cells from their surroundings. From
the huge variety of chemical and physical cues present in the extracellular space and influencing the development
and spread of cancer [31] we focus here on the effects of acidity and cell-tissue interactions. Since acidification
and angiogenesis are tightly interrelated and crucial for the tumor evolution, we also model vascularization, by
way of endothelial cell dynamics. We develop a multiscale model upon starting from the subcellular level of
interactions between cells, acidity, and tissue, setting up the corresponding kinetic transport equations (KTEs)
for glioma cells of the two phenotypes and for endothelial cells, and performing a parabolic limit to deduce
the macroscopic system of reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs for the involved quantities: total tumor burden
(moving + proliferating cells), endothelial cells, and acidity (concentration of protons).
2.1 Subcellular level
On the microscopic scale, we describe the interaction of glioma cells with the extracellular space, more precisely
with tissue fibers and protons. Cells exchange information with their environment through various transmem-
brane entities, e.g. cell surface receptors and ion channels. We will use the former to account for cell-tissue
interactions and both for the cell-proton exchange. Indeed, additionally to ion channels and membrane trans-
porters which have been extensively studied in the context of intra- and extracellular pH regulation, there also
exist proton-sensing receptors [43], e.g. the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved among others in
regulating the migration and proliferation of cells in tumor development and wound healing [47,91]. We ignore
here all intricate details about the intracellular machinery activated by receptor binding and channel opening
and closing. Instead, we see the events of occupying such transmembrane units as triggering the cellular pro-
cesses leading to migration, proliferation, and phenotypic switch.
2
Considering such interactions between cells and soluble as well as unsoluble ligands follows the idea employed
in [50, 51, 60] to build a micro-meso model for tumor invasion with chemo- and haptotaxis and revisited
in [14, 16, 19–21, 45] for cell-tissue interactions, in [57] for cell-proton interactions leading to pseudopalisade
patterns, or in [22] for a nonlocal micro-macro model with cell-tissue, cell-cell, and cell-protons interactions.
The micro-macro framework proposed in [38, 39, 41] offers a related, yet different perspective on the interplay
between intra- and extracellular acidity and tumor cells.
We denote by y1(t) the amount of receptors bound to tissue fibers and by y2(t) that of transmembrane entities
(ion channels, pH-sensing receptors) occupied by protons. The corresponding binding/occupying dynamics is
characterized by simple mass action kinetics:

Here R̄0 is the total amount of receptors on a cell membrane, Q(x) denotes the macroscopic tissue density,
depending on the position x ∈ Rn, Q∗(x) is the reference tissue density (corresponding to its carrying capac-
ity), while S(t, x) is the macroscopic concentration of protons, and Sc,0(x) the reference proton concentration.
Accordingly, we get the ODE system
ẏ1 =

ẏ2 =

Sc,0
S(t, x) (R̄0 − (y1 + y2))− k−2 y2
where k+1 and k
−
1 represent the attachment and detachment rates of cells to tissue, respectively, while k
+
2 and
k−2 are the corresponding rates in the process of proton binding. As in [22], we define y := y1 + y2 to be the
total amount of transmembrane entities occupied by tissue or protons, which allows us to lump together the
two ODEs, into
ẏ =

ẏ =

(R̄0 − y)− k−y . (1)
Since processes on this scale are much faster than those happening on the macroscopic time scale, they can
be assumed to equilibrate rapidly and moreover, that on this scale we can ignore the time dependence of S.
Rescaling y/R̄0  y will further simplify the notation. Then, the unique steady state of the above equation is

The variable y can be seen as characterizing the ’internal’ cellular state. In the kinetic theory of active particles
(see e.g. [5,6]) it is called ’activity variable’. In the sequel, we will consider the mesoscopic densities p(t, x, v, y)
and r(t, x, y) of migrating and respectively non-moving (thus proliferating) glioma cells, hence both depending
on such activity variable y. Thereby, v ∈ V ⊂ Rn is the cell velocity vector, with the space V to be closer
explained in Subsection 2.2 below.
Further, we assume that the glioma cells follow the tissue gradient, but move away from highly acidic areas.
Therefore, we look at the path of a single cell starting at position x0 and moving to position x with velocity
v in the (locally) time-invariant density fields Q and S, so that Q(x) = Q(x0 + vt), while S(x) = S(x0 − vt).
Denoting by z := y∗ − y the deviation of y from its steady state, we have:

2.2 Mesoscopic level
We model the mesoscale behavior of glioma and endothelial cells with the aid of kinetic transport equations
(KTEs) describing velocity-jump processes and taking into account the subcellular dynamics. Concretely, we
consider the following cell density functions:
• p(t, x, v, y) for moving glioma cells;
• r(t, x, y) for non-moving, hence (in virtue of the go-or-grow dichotomy) proliferating glioma cells;
• w(t, x, ϑ) for endothelial cells (ECs) forming capillaries,
with the time and space variables t > 0 and x ∈ Rn, velocities v ∈ V = sSn−1 and ϑ ∈ Θ := σSn−1, and activity
variable y ∈ Y = (0, 1). These choices mean that we assume for glioma and ECs constant speeds s > 0 and
σ > 0, respectively, where Sn−1 denotes the unit sphere in Rn. As in [19–21,45], in the sequel we will work with
the deviation z = y∗ − y ∈ Z ⊆ (y∗ − 1, y∗) rather then with y.
The corresponding macroscopic cell densities are denoted by M(t, x), R(t, x) and W (t, x), respectively, and we
use the notation N(t, x) := M(t, x) +R(t, x) for the space-time varying macroscopic total tumor burden.
The kinetic transport equation for the motile glioma phenotype is given by:
∂tp+∇x · (vp) + ∂z(G(z,Q, S)p) = Lp[λ(z)]p+ β(S)
q
ω
r − α(w, S)p− lm(N)p , (3)
where Lp[λ(z)]p denotes the turning operator, describing velocity changes. In particular, such changes are due
to contact guidance: the cells have a tendency to align to the brain tissue anisotropy, mainly associated with
white matter tracts. As in previous models of this type, Lp[λ]p is a Boltzmann-like integral operator of the
form
Lp[λ(z)]p = −λ(z)p+ λ(z)
∫
V
K(x, v) p(v′) dv′ , (4)
where λ(z) := λ0 − λ1z ≥ 0 is the cell turning rate depending on the microscopic variable z, while λ0 and
λ1 are positive constants. The integral term describes the reorientation of cells from any previous velocity v
′
to a new velocity v upon interacting with the tissue fibers. This is controlled by the turning kernel K(x, v),
which we assume to be independent on the incoming velocity v′. In particular, we consider that the dominating
directional cue is given by the orientation of tissue fibers and take as e.g. in [19, 71] K(x, v) :=
q(x,v̂)
ω
, where
v̂ = v|v| and q(x, θ) with θ ∈ S
n−1 is the orientational distribution of the fibers, normalized by ω = sn−1. It
encodes the individual brain structure obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); concrete choices will be
provided in Section 3. We assume the tissue to be undirected, hence q(x, θ) = q(x,−θ) for all x ∈ Rn. For later
reference, we introduce the notations
Eq(x) :=
∫
Sn−1
θq(x, θ)dθ
Vq(x) :=
∫
Sn−1
(θ − Eq)⊗ (θ − Eq) q(x, θ)dθ
for the mean fiber orientation and the variance-covariance matrix for the orientation distribution of tissue fibers,
respectively. Notice that the above symmetry of q implies Eq = 0.
4
The term β(S)
q
ω
r in (3) describes the phenotypic switch r → p; the rate β depends on S, since in a too acidic
environment the cells are supposed to stop proliferation and migrate towards regions with higher pH (see Sec-
tion 1). Therefore, we assume that β(S) is an increasing function of the proton concentration S and we require
β(S) > 0, since there will always be some proliferating cells switching into a migratory regime 1.
The terms α(w, S)p and lm(N)p model the phenotypic switch p → r due to environmental signals. Thus, the
former term depends on the proton concentration S and on the mesoscopic EC density w and describes the
adoption of a proliferative phenotype when there are enough oxygen and nutrient supply, while the acidity
remains below a certain threshold. The latter term models the switch to proliferation caused by the glioma
cell population being too crowded to allow effective migration (but still allowing some limited proliferation). In
order not to complicate too much the model we do not explicitly account for cell recession or quiescence.
The evolution of proliferating tumor cells is characterized by the integro-differential equation
∂tr = (α(w, S) + lm(N))

χ(x, z, z′)
Q(x)
Q∗(x)
r(z′)dz′ describes as in [20, 45] proliferation triggered by cell receptor binding to tissue. The
proliferation rate µ(W,N, S) depends on the total macroscopic tumor density N , on the concentration of protons
S, and on the vasculature. In the integral operator, the kernel χ(x, z, z′) characterizes the transition from state
z′ to state z during such proliferation-initiating interaction at position x. No further conditions are required
on χ, we only assume that the nonlinear proliferative operator is uniformly bounded in the L2-norm, which is
reasonable, in view of space-limited cell division. The last term −γ(S)r describes acid-induced death of glioma
cells when the pH value drops below a certain threshold.
The KTE for ECs is given by:
∂tw +∇x · (ϑw) = Lw[η]w + µW (W,Q)w , (6)
where the turning operator Lw[η]w describes changes in the orientation of ECs. It is well-established (see
e.g. [31]) that tumor cells produce angiogenic signals acting as chemoattractants for ECs. Less known is whether
such signals are expressed by proliferating rather than moving cells or by both phenotypes. There is, however,
evidence that hypoxia induces production of VEGF and other angiogenic cytokines (see e.g. [12, 78, 95] and
references therein). Since cancer cells are highly glycolytic (which leads to acidification), and increased glucose
metabolism is selected for in proliferating cells [61], we assume that pro-angiogenic signals are mainly produced
by proliferating cells. With the aim of avoiding the introduction of a new variable for the concentration of such
chemoattractants, we let the ECs be attracted by the proliferating glioma cells as main sources therewith. This
translates into the following form of the turning operator acting on the right hand side in (6):
Lw[η]w = −η(x, ϑ,R)w(t, x, ϑ) +
∫
Θ
1
|Θ|
η(x, ϑ′, R)w(ϑ′)dϑ′ ,
where for the turning kernel modeling ECs reorientations we simply took a uniform density function over the
unit sphere Sn−1 and
η(x, ϑ,R) = η0(x)e
−a(R)DtR (7)
represents the turning rate of ECs. It depends on the macroscopic density of proliferating tumor cells R and
on the pathwise gradient DtR = ∂tR + ϑ · ∇R. The coefficient function a(R) is related to the interactions
between ECs and proliferating glioma, more precisely ECs and pro-angiogenic signals produced by the latter.
This can be described for instance via equilibrium of EC receptor binding. This way to include directional bias
provides an alternative to that using a transport term with respect to the activity variable z in (3) and it has
been introduced in [70] in the context of bacteria movement and recently used in [57] for a model for glioma
pseudopalisade patterning. Under certain conditions, the relation between the two approaches was established
rigorously for bacteria chemotaxis in [73] and investigated more formally for glioma repellent pH-taxis in [57].
Finally, µW (W,Q)w is the proliferation term for ECs. Besides the total population of ECs irrespective of their
orientation, µW is supposed to depend on the available macroscopic tissue Q. More details about the concrete
choices of the coefficient functions involved in (3), (5), and (6) will be provided in Section 3.
2.3 Parabolic scaling of the mesoscopic model
The high dimensionality of the KTE system (3), (5), and (6) makes its numerical simulations too expensive.
Moreover, clinicians are interested in the macroscopic evolution of the tumor along with its vascularization and
1otherwise the tumor would stay confined, which is not the case for glioblastoma
5
acidity profile. Therefore, it is convenient to deduce effective equations for the macroscopic dynamics of ECs
and total tumor burden N = R + M . The PDE for the proton concentration S is already macroscopic and
does not need to be upscaled. We rescale the time and space variables as t → ε2t and x → εx. Moreover,
the proliferation terms in (5) and (6) and the death term in (5) will be scaled by ε2 in order to account for
the mitotic and apoptotic events taking place on a much larger time scale than migration and switching from
moving to non-moving regimes. Hence, (3), (5), and (6) become:

and neglect the higher order moments w.r.t. the variable z, in virtue of the subcellular dynamics being much
faster than the events on the higher scales, hence z � 1. We assume the functions p and r to be compactly
supported in the phase space Rn × V × Z and w to be compactly supported in Rn ×Θ.
We first integrate equation (8) with respect to z, getting the following equation for m(t, x, v):

From equation (20) we see that

thus w0 depends on the (constant) speed σ, but not on the direction θ ∈ Sn−1.
Now, turning to the equations stemming from the ε1-terms, from (24) we get:

α(w0, S) + lm(N0)

Mz1 (x, t) . (36)

Using the fact that the tissue is undirected, i.e. Eq = 0 and (36), the previous equation leads to:

= ∇x · (vm0)− λ1mz1 . (42)
In order to get an explicit expression for m1, we would like to invert the operator L̄m[λ0+α(w0, S)+lm(N0)]. As
e.g. in [19,71], we define it on the weighted L2-space L2q(V ), in which the measure dv is weighted by q(x, v̂)/ω.
In particular, L2q(V ) can be decomposed as L
2
q(V ) =< q/ω > ⊕ < q/ω >⊥. Due to the properties of the chosen
turning kernel, L̄m[λ0 + α(w0, S) + lm(N0)] is a compact Hilbert-Schmidt operator with kernel < q/ω >. We
can therefore calculate its pseudo-inverse on < q/ω >⊥.
Thus, to determine m1 from (42) we need to check the solvability condition∫
V
[∇x · (vm0)− λ1mz1] dv = 0 .
This holds thanks to the above results and to the symmetry of q(x, v̂). Therefore, we obtain from (42) and (40)
m1 = −

λ0 + α(w0, S) + lm(N0)

(43)
and
M1 = 0 . (44)
On the other hand, (25) and (35) give:
∇x · (ϑw0) = −η0(x)w1 + η0(x)a(R0)ϑ · ∇R0w0 + Sσnη0(x)W1 . (45)
Likewise, we observe that the operator L̄w[η0]w1 := −η0(x)w1 + Sσnη0(x)W1 can be inverted, so that (45) leads
to
w1 = −
1
η0(x)
∇x · (ϑw0) + w0a(R0)ϑ · ∇R0 (46)

The two macroscopic equations obtained in (53) and (56) for the evolution of the tumor and ECs, respectively,
are coupled with a PDE for proton concentration dynamics:
∂tS = DS∆S + g(S,N0,W0, Q) , (57)
with the concrete form of g(S,N0,W0, Q) given in (65).

In view of (29), (41), (44), and (47), the ε-correction terms for N and W can be left out and ignoring the higher
order terms we get the following closed PDE system characterizing the macroscopic evolution of the tumor

(54) and (55), respectively, whereby we used w = W|Θ| , in virtue of (20). This system has to be supplemented
with adequate initial conditions; its deduction has been carried out for x ∈ Rn. For the numerical simulations
to be performed in Section 4, we will consider it to be set in a bounded, sufficiently regular domain Ω ⊂ Rn
and endow it with no-flux boundary conditions.
The next section is dedicated to specifying the remaining coefficients of the above macroscopic system.
3 Assessment of coefficients
To determine the tumor diffusion tensor DT (x) in (51) we need to provide a concrete form for the (mesoscopic)
orientational distribution of tissue fibers q(x, θ). Several different choices are available in the literature, see
e.g. [14, 71]. As in [45] we use the orientation distribution function (ODF):
q(x, θ) =
1
4π|DW (x)|
1
2 (θT (DW (x))−1θ)
3
2
,
where DW (x) is the water diffusion tensor obtained from processing the (patient-specific) DTI data.
We choose for the macroscopic tissue density Q(x) the expression proposed in [20]:
Q(x) = 1−
l3c(x)
h3
, (59)
where h is the side length of one voxel of the DTI dataset and lc a characteristic length, estimated as
lc(x) =
√
tr(DW (x))h2
4l1
with l1 being the leading eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor DW .
For the rate α(w, S) describing the cell phenotypic switch p → r from migration to proliferation, we choose
a combination of an increasing function of w and a decreasing function of S. As explained in Subsection 2.2,
this rate is influenced by the availability of nutrient (provided by vasculature) for sustaining the processes
involved in the cell cycle and by the pH of the environment; the dynamical balance of these factors decides the
migratory/mitotic fate. Recalling (35), we set
α(W,S) = α0
SσnW/Wc,0
Sσn + S
σ
nW/Wc,0
1
1 + S/Sc,0
, (60)
where Wc,0 and Sc,0 are reference values for EC density and proton concentration, respectively.
The second rate of phenotypic switch p → r lm(N), describing the influence of a crowed environment on cell
phenotype changes, is chosen as
lm(N) = lm,0 (1 + tanh(N/Nc,0 −N∗/Nc,0)) , (61)
where N∗ represents a threshold value for glioma density: when it is exceeded, the cells are not able to move
anymore. The constant Nc,0 denotes a reference value for the density of (moving and proliferating) glioma cells.
12
The switching rate r → p given by the function β(S) controls the acidity-triggered motility enhancement of
formerly proliferating cells. We set
β(S) = β0 [ε+ (S/Sc,0 − ST,1/Sc,0)+] (62)
with ε � 1 and (·)+ the positive part. ST,1 is the pH threshold which, when underrun, induces the cells to
switch from a proliferative to a migrative phenotype.
Although tumor cells can live in an environment with substantially lower pH than that for normal tissue [23,90],
when it drops below a certain threshold (which in terms of proton concentration we denote by ST,2), the cancer
cells become necrotic [24,90]. This suggests the following cell death coefficient γ(S):
γ(S) = γ0(S/Sc,0 − ST,2/Sc,0)+ . (63)
The growth rate µ(W,N, S) can be also defined in different ways and it should be motivated by biological
evidence. As, for instance, in [20], we choose a logistic-like function to describe the growth self-limitation and
a growth enhancement factor depending on the vascularization W , along with a growth-limiting one due to
acidification, like that employed in (60):
µ(W,N, S) = µN,0

Here, KN is the tumor carrying capacity and µN,0 is a constant. The term −ce NeKNe is related to the extension
of the model described in Section 5. In particular, ce = 0 when we consider the evolution of system (58), while
ce = 1 when the dynamics of healthy tissue and necrotic tissues (Ne) are included. KNe represents the carrying
capacity for the necrotic component.
Similarly, for the term µW (W,Q) describing proliferation of ECs we take

For the tactic sensitivity �a(R) = η0a(R)DEC of ECs towards (gradients of) proliferating glioma cells, we need
to specify the function a(R) involved in the definition (7) of the EC turning rate. We choose
a(R) = χa0

which corresponds to the rate of change of the expression ζ(R) = R

representing the equilibrium of the
interactions between ECs and proliferating glioma cells R, scaled by a constant χa0 that is used to account for
changes in the turning rate per unit of change in dζ/dt. Thereby, we assume that attachment and detachment
of ECs and R-cells happen with the same rates.

hence it has a source term for the production of protons by the tumor, and a decay term, as the protons are

In Table 1 we report the range of the values for the constant parameters involved in system (58), as well as the
references from which they were drawn. In order to simplify, we assume a constant coefficient η0 in the turning
rate (7) for ECs. Further details on the estimation of the parameters and on the nondimensionalization of (58)
are given in Appendix A and B.

The initial pH distribution is calculated considering that pH0 = − log10(S0). Figure 1 shows the plots for the
initial conditions on the entire 2D brain slice, zooming then in the region Ω̄ = [−35, 5] × [−15, 25]. Figure 2
shows the initial tissue density estimated with (59).
The numerical simulations are performed with a self-developed code in Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA).
The computational domain is a horizontal brain slice reconstructed from the processing of an MRI scan. The
macroscopic tensor DT (x) is precalculated using DTI data and the ODF for the fiber distribution function (see
Section 3). The dataset was acquired at the Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo (Galdakao, Spain), and approved by
its Ethics Committee: all the methods employed were in accordance to approved guidelines. A Galerkin finite
element scheme for the spatial discretization of the equations for tumor cells, ECs, and proton concentration is

considered, together with an implicit Euler scheme for the time discretization. We present different simulations
addressing several aspects.
Firstly, we study the behavior of species involved in (58) for the parameters listed in Table 1. The corresponding
simulation results are shown in Figure 3, where the five columns report the evolution of the whole tumor mass
(N), the two subpopulations of proliferating (R) and migrating (M) tumor cells, the endothelial cells (W ), and
pH (computed from S). The tumor spread, which seems to mainly depend on the choice of the parameters
λ0 and s, as well as on the EC evolution, is rather slow, with a partial exchange between the two subpopula-
tions of tumor cells in relation to pH at the core of the tumor mass. The tumor cells increasingly adopt the
proliferating phenotype when they approach ECs, as they provide the necessary nutrient and oxygen supply to
sustain glioma proliferation. On the other hand, ECs diffuse and grow, with a higher accumulation around the
first of the three vessels situated in the upper part of the plots and where there is more healthy tissue available
to sustain their proliferation. They clearly exhibit tactic behavior toward the (pro-angiogenic growth factors
released by) proliferating tumor cells mainly located around the core of the neoplasm. In particular, the sub-
plots for the evolution of ECs at later times (last two rows of Figure 3) show an increasing amount of high EC
aggregates developing towards the tumor. This behavior can be associated with the phenomenon of microvas-
cular hyperplasia and glomeruloid bodies. The latter are tumor-associated vascular structures that develop in
the presence of high levels of VEGF and are important histopathological features of glioblastoma multiforme [77].
In Figure 4 we show comparisons between simulations done upon varying the parameters λ0, referring to the
turning rate of glioma cells, and the two speeds (s, σ) for tumor and endothelial cells, respectively, with the aim
to illustrate how sensitive the model predictions are w.r.t. these parameters. The tumor and EC densities are
plotted after 560 days of evolution for three different values of λ0 (expressed in s
−1), i.e., 10−4, 10−3 and 10−2,
and for four pairs (s, σ) of speed values (expressed in µm· h−1), i.e., (15, 20), (20, 15), (30, 20), and (30, 25).
The simulations suggest that vascularization at the tumor site requires a sufficiently large glioma turning rate
λ0 accompanied by relatively large EC speed σ. A too small λ0 effects the (biologically rather unrealistic) shift
of tumor cells from their original location to the site of blood vessels, where they switch to the proliferative
15

phenotype. The faster the glioma cells are, the more pronounced is this behavior, obviously dominated by
migration during its first stage and subsequent proliferation. Increasing λ0 by one or two orders of magnitude
leads to more realistic behaviors of tumor cells and ECs, with less sensitivity towards variations in λ0. Naturally,
wide-spread hyperplasia and pronounced tumor invasion occur for higher cell speeds.
In order to test the effect of the go-or-grow dichotomy on the evolution of cell populations involved in system
(58), we compare that model with a setting in which the tumor cells migrate and proliferate without deterring
one of these phenotypes for the other. In particular, we do not differentiate between proliferating and migrating
cells and accordingly let the ECs be biased by the density gradient of the whole tumor. Using a scaling argument
similar to the one described in Section 2.3, we get a system of three partial differential equations for tumor
cells (N1), ECs (W1), and protons (S1), which is analogous to (58) with α0 = 0 and lm,0 = 0. This choice of
parameters reduces the former coefficient functions to ϕ(w0, N, S) = 1 and %(w0, N, S) = λ0. We refer to this
setting as Model NGG. Figure 5 shows the solution behavior for this new setting. The initial conditions for the
three populations are the same as those shown in Figure 1. Comparing Figures 3 and 5 we observe that the
go-or-growth model predicts -as expected- a slower tumor spread, with lower cell density, that, consequently,
induces lower acidity concentrations in the environment, and the differences between the two settings becoming
more accentuated with increasing time. Moreover, the taxis driving ECs towards the tumor mass is stronger
for the case shown in Figure 5, and accumulations of ECs indicating microvascular hyperplasia are now earlier
formed and become larger.
To enable a direct assessment of the two settings we plot in Figure 6 the differences (at 400 and 560 days) between
the (overall) densities of tumor and endothelial cells for the model with go-or-grow and its NGG counterpart
(the quantities for the latter are marked by the index 1), as well as between the respective pH distributions, the
latter illustrated on a larger domain Ω̃ = [−40, 10] × [−20, 30]. The described features concerning tumor/EC
spread and aggregation along with acidity distribution can be clearly observed.

5 Tissue degradation, necrosis, and tumor grading
We extend the above model by considering the evolution of macroscopic tissue density Q and that of necrotic
matter Ne, the latter including tissue as well as glioma cells degraded by hypoxia. The whole system consists

Thereby d0,Q > 0 denotes the tissue degradation rate and (·)+ means as usual the positive part. Details on the

Numerical simulations for the extended model (58), (66) are shown in Figure 8, corresponding to the initial con-
ditions in Figure 7. Figure 9 illustrates the evolution of proliferating and migrating glioma cells. Although the
qualitative behavior of glioma and endothelial cells is comparable with that shown in Figure 3, the degradation
of tissue by environmental acidity affects both tumor and EC proliferation, as less healthy tissue is available to
sustain growth. Therefore, the simulations show lower densities for both species and, particularly, tumor cell
growth is affected by the reduction of vasculature and the depletion of healthy tissue, as clearly shown by the
evolution of the proliferating tumor cells in Figure 9 (first row). Moreover, Figure 8 shows that lower tumor

density effects less proton extrusion, i.e. higher pH.
The above model extension enables us to perform necrosis-based tumor grading, which is essential for assessing
patient survival and treatment planning. Other indicators of tumor aggressiveness are employed as well (e.g.
histological patterns [92] or tumor size [75]), however, we focus here on grading by the amount of necrosis
relative to the whole tumor volume, in view of [29,36], where the tumor volume by itself was found to have no
influence on overall survival. Following [15], we define the time-dependent grade G(t) ∈ [0, 1] of the simulated
tumor via:
G(t) :=
VNe(t)
VNe(t) + VN (t)
(67)
where VNe(t) and VN (t) denote, respectively, the fractions of necrosis and living cell densities in the visible
tumor volume. They are defined as the integrals of the densities Ne and N over the domain defined by the level

sets of the tumor population for a detection threshold of 80% of the carrying capacity, which corresponds to the
detection threshold for T1-Gd images [86]. We represent in Figure 10 the time evolution of G, guided by the
percentage classification in [29], i.e., 0 < G < 25%: grade 1, 25% ≤ G < 50%: grade 2, and G ≥ 50: grade 3.
The highest grade corresponds to the most aggressive tumor and the poorest survival prognosis. In particular,
we compare the effect of four different scenarios on necrosis-based tumor grading: the grey curves therein refer
to the extended model (58), (66)) involving vascularization, i.e. EC density W (solid line: go-or-grow, dotted
line: Model NGG), while the red curves illustrate the evolution of G for the corresponding variants of the
extended model without EC dynamics (i.e., without W ).
Figure 10 provides rich information. On the one hand, it shows that assuming the go-or-grow dichotomy leads
to slower progression of neoplasia, due to the cells deterring one phenotype for the other. Indeed, in the long
run, the full go-or-grow model with vascularization predicts a slower advancement towards high tumor grades.
When EC dynamics are accounted for, the differences between the model with or without go-or-grow are rather
small; when W is, instead, not included, then such differences increase. The vascularization seems to have
a significant impact: if we focus e.g., on Model NGG (dotted curves) we see that during the first simulated
14-15 weeks the vascularization ensures a higher percentage of necrosis, after which the situation reverses, with
differences becoming larger while time is advancing. The early phase (which is supposed to correspond to
a lower tumor grade) might seem somehow paradoxical when thinking about blood capillaries buffering the
acidity and reducing necrosis. It is, however, well-known that a tumor usually develops angiogenesis when it
has reached a more advanced phase in its development and begun to get increasingly hypoxic, which leads to
enhanced VEGF expression and capillary formation. The small amount of vessels prior to such stage is on the
one side supporting the growth of tumor cells, while on the other side it is not able to buffer the ever increasing
proton concentration triggered by the exuberant growth. Without a substantial enhancement of angiogenesis,
the tumor will develop a larger necrotic component, thus receiving a higher grade. Therefore, omitting the
dynamics of endothelial cells from the model might overestimate the tumor growth and spread, which for brain

variants, but without vascularization. In both cases we set µN,0 = 5.79 · 10−6 s−1.
tumors can have a significant therapeutic impact.
6 Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first continuous mathematical model with pH- and vasculature-induced phenotypic
switch between moving and proliferating cells where the two cell types are seen as distinct tumor subpopulations
evolving under mutual, direct and indirect interactions. As such, it can be seen as a further development of the
models in [21,45]. This novel model not only includes on the macroscopic scale nonlinear, myopic self-diffusion
and multiple taxis (haptotaxis, repellent pH-taxis) for one of the tactic populations (glioma cells), but also
features taxis of the second population (ECs) towards only one part of the former: the ECs are following, in
21
fact, the gradient of proliferating glioma. Thereby, the chemorepellent is produced by the population (glioma
cells) which tries to avoid it, but at the same time is degraded by the other tactic actor (ECs), which is, in
turn, directionally biased by (a part of) the first one. This renders the repellent acidity taxis of glioma cells
both direct and indirect. The extended model involving dynamics of tissue and necrotic matter involves, too,
an indirect kind of haptotaxis, with yet more complex couplings. These features raise several highly interesting
questions related to rigorous well-posedness and long term behavior of solutions. Among others, the simula-
tions showed that for certain parameter combinations the solution can infer singularities. For a recent review
of available models with multiple taxis we refer to [55].
We used a multiscale approach starting from single cell dynamics for glioma interacting with (macroscopically
represented) extracellular acidity and tissue, we wrote the corresponding kinetic transport equations for glioma
and EC density distribution functions on the mesoscopic scale, and employed a parabolic scaling to deduce the
population level behavior for the model variables: glioma density, acid concentration (or pH), EC density, and
-for the extended model- densities of normal tissue and necrotic matter. Thereby, tumor cell migration is driven
as in previous works, e.g, [19,21,71], by a myopic diffusion term involving a tumor diffusion tensor which takes
into account the local tissue structure. Moreover, taxis terms carrying information from the microscopic scale
direct glioma migration towards increasing tissue gradients and away from highly acidic regions. We consid-
ered a heterogeneous tumor and used the go-or-grow dichotomy asserting that glioma cells can either move or
proliferate, the respective behavior being transient and switching according to nutrient availability (supplied by
vasculature), pH (determined by proton production and buffering), as well as crowded environments.
The deduced macroscopic motion of ECs is characterized, too, by a combination of diffusion and drift terms. In
order not to increase too much the number of solution components, we described rather indirectly the response
of ECs to pro-angiogenic growth factors (e.g. VEGFs), upon biasing their tactic motion towards proliferating
tumor cells. This was realized in an alternative manner to that by which taxis terms have been obtained for
glioma cells.
The extension of the model by taking into account the macroscopic evolution of healthy tissue and necrotic
matter opened the way for necrosis-based tumor grading, which is highly relevant for diagnosis and therapy
planning. A forthcoming work will be dedicated to several aspects of the latter issue.
The validation of model predictions through comparison with adequate patient data would be a future task
to address. Although the available technology is potentially able to provide a large amount of the needed
quantitative information, the standard clinical imaging and therewith associated treatment does not provide
such data sets, among others due to prohibitively high costs. With the advent of technological development
and the advancement of personalized medicine, however, such data may become available in the near future.

A Parameter assessment
A.1 Turning rates and diffusion related parameters: λ0, λ1, s, σ, η0, DS
λ0, λ1: In [79] the authors presented experiments on the migratory behavior and turning frequency of metastatic
cancer cells from rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line, reporting values for λ0 in the range [0.01− 0.1] s−1.
Considering the highly aligned brain structure which influences cell migration upon enhancing cell persistence
in the favorable direction of motion, we assume a reduction of the turning likelihood and take the range
[10−4 − 10−2] s−1 for the parameter λ0. The choice of λ1 is, unfortunately, rather imprecise, since we found no
data or references. In [19] variations of this parameter by ±50% were tested in a similar context. As proposed
there, we consider the same order of magnitude for λ0 and λ1.
s: Different references are available for the tumor cell speed. In a recent work [18], four types of typical GBM
cell lines were cultured in a microfabricated 3D model to study their in vitro behavior; according to that, we
22
consider for glioma cell speed the range [10.2− 30] µm · h−1. A further upper limit for this parameter can be
found in [76], where a maximum speed of 54− 60µm · h−1 was reported for glioma cells.
σ: For the average speed of ECs, in [17] the range σ ∈ [10 − 50] µm · h−1 was reported for individual cells in
several culture conditions. In vivo, the registered mean speed for motile endocardial and endothelial cells is of
approximately 20 µm · h−1.
η0: In [87], the authors analyzed the statistical properties of the random streaming behavior for endothelial
cell cultures. In particular, they estimated a needed time T = 5m to alter cell polarity and influence the cell
turning. With this value, they obtained a cell speed estimation in the range of 2040µm · h−1 within monolayers,
in agreement with their empirical data about cell speed in [10−30] µm · h−1. Following their results we consider
η0 ∈ [0.0001− 0.003] s−1.
DS : From [59], we get an estimation of the diffusion coefficient for different ions; an average value between
[0.3 − 10] · 10−3 mm2·s−1 is reported. We test the model for different values of this parameter and we chose
DS = 0.5 · 10−3 mm2· s−1. DS was rescaled in the simulations in order to account for the fast dynamics
characterizing proton evolution.
A.2 Phenotypic switch related parameters: α0, β0, lm,0, N
∗, ST,1, ST,2, γ0
α0, β0, lm,0: The estimation of reasonable ranges for the values of the phenotypic switch parameters α0 and
β0 might be quite imprecise, since there are no specific data or references available. However, considering the
experiment done in [54, 72], it is possible to define a wide range for the duration of the glioma cell cycle that
translates into α0, β0 ∈ [0.09− 1] · 10−4 s−1. Analogous arguments apply for the rate lm,0, for which there are
not estimations directly derived from biological data. For these reasons we test the model for several values of
α0, β0, lm,0 with order of magnitude 10
−4.
N∗: Due to the lack of biological data, for the estimation of this parameter related to the total tumor density
level that still allows cells movement, we choose it to be proportional to the estimated tumor carrying capacity,
referring to the range [0.6− 0.9] ·KN proposed in [8, 74].
ST,1, ST,2: Following the pH range [6.4 − 7.3] proposed in [88, 90] for the brain tumor microenvironment, we
choose the thresholds values that determines the phenotypic switch from a proliferating to a migrating cells
(ST,1) and the acid-mediated death of the resting cells (ST,2). We set ST,1 = 1.995 · 10−7 M (referring to a
pH= 6.7), and ST,2 = 3.98 · 10−7 M (referring to a pH= 6.4).
γ0: In [86], the authors assumed the cell necrosis rate to be proportional to their metabolic rate µN,0. In
particular, this estimation appears reasonable, considering also our assumption in the parabolic scaling procedure
about having similar time scales for birth and death. Therefore, we set γ0 = µN,0/50.

−, χa0
k+1 , k

2 : For the estimation of the attachment rates between tumor cell and ECM or protons, we refer
to [58]. In particular, for both the cell-ECM attachment rate and the cell-protons interaction rate, we set
k+1 = k
+
2 = 10
4 (M s)−1. Then, assuming that the main ECM component is collagen, with a molecular weight of
≈ 300kDa, and taking into account the reference value Q∗ (in Table 2), we deduce k+1 = 0.034 s
−1. Analogously,
considering the reference value for the protons concentration Sc,0 (in Table 2), we get k
+
2 = 0.01 s
−1.
k−: For the estimation of the cells-ECM and cells-protons detachment rate, referring to [58], we set k− =
0.01 s−1.
χa0 : We estimate the parameter χa0 by considering the values reported in [84] and [83] for the chemotactic
sensitivity. In particular, in [84] the authors analyzed the chemotactic coefficient of migrating endothelial cells
in gradients of aFGF, measuring a maximum chemotactic response of 2600 cm2·(M s)−1 at a concentration of
aFGF around 10−10 M. Instead, in the further work [83], the authors analyzed the changes of this parameter in
response to cell speed and persistence time. Taking into account the above described range for the EC speed,
we get χa0 ∈ [3.09− 4.5] d.
A.4 Proliferation related parameters: µN,0, KN , µW,0, KW
µN,0: For the estimation of glioma growth rate, we analyze the doubling times reported in [49] for several
glioma cell lines. There, the authors reported a range of variably between 21.1h and 46h, which translated into
µN,0 ∈ [0.42− 0.9] · 10−5 s−1.
KN , KW : Considering that the mean diameter of a glioma cell is around [12− 14]µm [1], we estimate a value
for the tumor carrying capacity of KN ∼ 106 cells ·mm−3. In the same way, considering a mean diameter for
an endothelial cell of [10− 20]µm [2], we set KW ∼ 106 cells ·mm3.

µW,0: The doubling time of EC density has been estimated in several experiments to vary between the different
phases of an endothelial colony growth until the formation of a monolayer. In [4, 30], the authors gave a range
of variability for the value of the EC doubling time of [3− 13] d. This leads to µW,0 ∈ [0.62− 2.7] · 10−6 s−1.
A.5 Production and consumption related parameters g0,N , g0,W , d0,Q, ST,Q
gs: In [23], the authors estimated the rate of proton production due to tumor cell activity by fitting their
equation for proton dynamics (analogous to our PDE (57)) to a converted form of the data in [62]. In particu-
lar, in [62] pH measurements were taken at a variety of points within both the tumor and surrounding healthy
tissue for four composite cases, giving a geometric mean for the production rate of 2.2·10−20 M · mm3 ·(s·cell)−1.
gd: Following [23,63], for the rate of proton uptake by vasculature we consider the range of variability given by
[0.66− 1.1] · 10−4 s−1. As for DS , proton production and consumption rates were rescaled in the simulations in
order to account for the fast dynamics characterizing proton evolution.
d0,Q: For the rate of tissue degradation due to the acidic environment, in [86] the authors proposed an esti-
mation choosing the parameter such that 10% necrosis gives tissue a 50-day half-life. Starting from the value
proposed in [86], we test a wider range of possible estimations, that translates into d0,Q ∈ [0.005− 0.07] d−1.
ST,Q: In [88], tissue pH values in normal brain and in brain tumors were reported. Specifically, considering
that these values vary depending on the type of brain tissue (i.e., gray matter, white matter, cerebellum), the
minimum pH requires for the normal cell activity is in the range of [6.94 − 6.74]. For these reasons, we set
ST,Q = 1.995 · 10−7 M (referring to a pH= 6.7).
B Nondimensionalization
To proceed with nondimensionalizing the system, we firstly observe that the variables N , W , and Ne involved in
systems (58) and (66) are expressed in cells/mm3, Q in g/mm3, while the concentration of protons S is given in
mol/liter (=:M). The reference values we use for the nondimensionalization are listed in Table 2. In particular,
we rescale the tumor, EC, and necrotic matter (dead cells and tissue) densities with respect to their carrying
capacities, i.e., Nc,0 = KN , Wc,0 = KW , and Ne,0 = KN , assuming a similar carrying capacity for tumor cells
and necrosis.
